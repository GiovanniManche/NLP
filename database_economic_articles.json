      "content": "PRESS RELEASE July 2025 euro area bank lending survey 22 July 2025 Credit standards for firm loans remained broadly unchanged Credit standards tightened slightly for housing loans and more markedly for consumer credit Housing loan demand continued to increase strongly, while demand for firm loans remained weak According to the July 2025 bank lending survey (BLS), euro area banks reported broadly unchanged credit standards – banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the second quarter of 2025 (net percentage of banks of -1%; Chart 1). Banks also reported a slight net tightening of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of 2%) and a more pronounced net tightening for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of 11%). For credit standards on loans to firms, the net percentage was smaller than banks had e pected in the previous survey (a net tightening of 5%) and follows the small net tightening in credit standards seen in the first quarter (3%). Perceived risks related to the economic outlook continued to contribute to a tightening of credit standards, whereas competition had an easing impact. For the most part, banks reported no specific additional tightening impact on their credit standards related to geopolitical uncertainty and trade tensions, although they intensified their monitoring of the most e posed sectors and firms. For loans to households for house purchase, the net tightening followed the easing of credit standards seen in the first quarter (-7%) but was lower than banks anticipated (7%). For both housing loans and consumer credit, changes in risk perceptions and the risk tolerance of banks were the main drivers of the net tightening of credit standards. For the third quarter of 2025, banks e pect credit standards to remain unchanged for firms (0%), ease slightly for housing loans (-3%) and tighten further for consumer credit (4%). Banks’ overall – the actual agreed in loan contracts – eased for loans to firms, remained unchanged for housing loans and tightened for consumer credit. In the second quarter of 2025, euro area banks reported a slight net increase in demand for loans or credit lines to firms (Chart 2), with demand remaining weak overall. This followed a small net decrease in loan demand in the previous quarter (-3%) and was broadly in line with banks’ expectations in that quarter (4%). Loan demand was supported by declining interest rates, but dampened by global uncertainty and trade tensions, while the impact of fi ed investment and inventories and working capital was neutral. Demand for housing loans continued to increase substantially in net terms. Declining interest rates, improved housing market prospects and, to a lesser e tent, consumer confidence, were the main drivers of the continued increase in housing loan demand. Demand for consumer credit and other lending to households increased only slightly, with declining interest rates and other factors offsetting negative contributions from lower consumer confidence and spending on durable goods. In the third quarter of 2025, banks e pect a net increase in loan demand from firms (net percentage of 7%), a further substantial net increase for housing loans (net percentage of 21%) and broadly unchanged demand for consumer credit (1%). Euro area banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding improved slightly in the second quarter of 2025, driven by short-term retail funding, money markets and debt securities, and remained broadly unchanged for securitisations. Over the next three months, banks e pect access to these funding sources to remain broadly unchanged. Euro area banks reported that non-performing loan (NPL) ratios and other credit quality indicators had a net tightening impact on their credit standards across all loan categories, as well as a net tightening impact on for loans to firms and consumer credit. Banks e pect these trends to continue in the third quarter for loans to firms and consumer credit, driven mostly by pressures related to supervisory or regulatory requirements. Changes in credit standards and loan demand were heterogeneous across the main economic sectors in the first half of 2025. Credit standards tightened in commercial real estate (CRE), manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade and, to a lesser e tent, in construction, while they eased slightly across most services (e cluding financial services and real estate) and in residential real estate (RRE). Banks reported a net decrease in loan demand for construction, manufacturing, CRE and wholesale and retail trade, and net increases in RRE and in the transport, accommodation and food services sectors. For the second half of 2025, in most of the main economic sectors, banks e pect either broadly unchanged or easier credit standards and overall small changes in loan demand. The e ception is RRE, for which banks e pect a further moderate increase. Banks continue to take firms’ climate performance into consideration in their lending policies, reporting an easing impact on credit standards and for green firms and firms in transition and a tightening impact for high-emitting firms over the past twelve months. Both physical risk and firms’ transition risk had a moderate net tightening impact on banks’ lending policies, while climate-related fiscal support continued to have an easing impact. Banks also reported a net increase in demand for loans to green firms and firms in transition owing to climate change, while uncertainty over future climate regulation was perceived as an obstacle. Banks e pect a similar impact overall over the next twelve months. Based on a new question on the impact of climate change on housing loans, banks reported an easing impact on credit standards for buildings with high energy performance and a tightening impact for buildings with low energy performance over the past twelve months. They e pect a broadly corresponding impact over the next twelve months. As the easing impact for new buildings mostly offset the tightening impact for old buildings, the net impact of energy performance was low overall. The physical risk of real estate was, however, an important driver of further net tightening in lending conditions overall, and an even higher net percentage of banks reported that it will be a driver over the next year. Banks also reported a positive impact on loan demand for buildings with high and medium energy performance but a negative impact for those with low energy performance. Investment in energy performance was the key factor for climate-related loan demand, supported by preferential lending rates for increasing sustainability, whereas uncertainty over future climate regulation was reported as a dampening factor for loan demand. Banks indicated that changes in e cess liquidity held with the Eurosystem in the first half of 2025 had a neutral impact on bank lending conditions. They e pect to see similar effects in the second half of 2025. The quarterly BLS was developed by the Eurosystem to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the July 2025 survey relate to changes observed in the second quarter of 2025 and changes e pected in the third quarter of 2025, unless otherwise indicated. The July 2025 survey round was conducted between 13 June and 1 July 2025. A total of 155 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

      "content": "PRESS RELEASE Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises: firms report lower interest rates amid pressures arising from trade tensions 21 July 2025 Firms continued to report declining interest rates on bank loans, while indicating a slight tightening of other lending conditions. The bank loan financing gap remained stable, with firms reporting that both needs for bank loans and the availability of bank loans were broadly unchanged. Firms’ one-year-ahead median inflation expectations decreased to 2.5%, down from 2.9%, while median inflation expectations three and five years ahead remained unchanged at 3.0%. Most firms reported that they had been affected to some e tent by trade tensions, with firms e porting to the United States and firms in the manufacturing sector being the most e posed. In the most recent round of the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE), covering the second quarter of 2025, euro area firms reported a net decrease in interest rates on bank loans (a net -14%, compared with 12% in the previous quarter), suggesting that monetary policy easing is being transmitted to firms. At the same time, a net 16% of firms (down from 24% in the previous quarter) observed increases both in other financing costs (i.e. charges, fees and commissions) and in collateral requirements (a net 11%, down from 13% in the first quarter of 2025) (Chart 1). In this survey round, firms indicated a broadly unchanged need for bank loans (a net 1% indicating a decline, down from 4% in the first quarter of 2025, Chart 2) and stable availability of bank loans (a net 1% indicating an increase, compared with a net 1% indicating a decrease in the previous quarter). This left the bank loan financing gap – an inde capturing the difference between the need for and the availability of bank loans – broadly unchanged (a net ‑1%, the same as in the previous survey round). Looking ahead, firms e pect a slight improvement in the availability of e ternal financing over the next three months. Firms continued to perceive the general economic outlook to be the main factor hampering the availability of e ternal financing (a net 17%, compared with a net 21% in the previous survey round). A net 6% of firms indicated an improvement in banks’ willingness to lend (broadly unchanged from the previous survey round). A net 8% of firms reported an increase in turnover over the last three months, up from 6% in the previous survey round, with a net 23% of firms being optimistic about developments in the next quarter, although less so than in the previous quarter. Firms continued to see a deterioration in their profits (a net 13%, compared with 16% in the previous survey round), with the decline being more widespread among small and medium-sized enterprises. The survey indicates that a net 50% of firms reported rising cost pressures over the past three months, although to a lesser e tent than in the previous quarter. On average, firms’ e pected selling price growth declined to 2.5%, from 2.9% in previous survey round, while the corresponding figure for wages was 2.8% (down from 3.0% in the previous round) (Chart 3). At the same time, firms signalled a lower increase in non-labour input costs (3.4%, down from 4.0% in the previous round). Firms’ inflation expectations for the short term decreased, while remaining unchanged at longer horizons (Chart 4). Median expectations for annual inflation one year ahead declined to 2.5%, from 2.9%, while those for three and five years ahead saw no change, remaining at 3.0%. For inflation five years ahead, the majority of firms continue to indicate, although less so than in the previous round, that risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside (52%, down from 55%), with more firms perceiving balanced risks (33%, up from 30%), leaving the share of firms seeing downside risks unchanged at 14%. In this survey round, ad hoc questions were introduced to e amine the impacts of recent trade tensions – specifically the announcements of tariffs imposed by the United States – on the business strategies of euro area firms. The intensity of the impact of trade tensions varies significantly across firms, with firms e porting to the US and those in the manufacturing sector being particularly e posed. Appro imately 30% of firms e press concerns regarding delays or shortages in supply chains. In addition, firms indicated the need to seek alternative suppliers. Survey replies also revealed that the main strategies employed to adapt to the changing trade environment include refocusing sales within domestic and EU markets and restructuring supply chains (Chart 5). The report published today presents the main results of the 35th round of the SAFE survey for the euro area. The survey was conducted between 30 May and 27 June 2025. In this survey round, firms were asked about economic and financing developments over the period between April and June 2025. Additionally, firms also reported their expectations for euro area inflation, selling prices and other costs, and they replied to ad hoc questions on trade tensions and investments in artificial intelligence technologies. Altogether, the sample comprised 5,367 firms in the euro area, of which 4,924 (92%) had fewer than 250 employees.",

Since the publication of the second progress report , the ECB has continued to make progress on the draft digital euro scheme rulebook, which aims to harmonise digital euro payments across the euro area and ensure a modern, user-friendly e perience. E tensive feedback from the Rulebook Development Group – comprising representatives from the European retail payments market – has helped improve rulebook sections, as have insights from dedicated ECB workstreams featuring around 50 market participants (representing over 30 organisations) and sessions with industry experts on specific topics such as risk management and dispute management. At the same time, the ECB has intensified e perimentation and user research to ensure that the digital euro meets the needs of end users. Through the recently launched innovation platform , around 70 market participants have conducted technical tests of features such as conditional payments and e plored conceptual ideas and use cases for integrating the digital euro into the financial ecosystem. In parallel, the ECB has engaged directly with small merchants, vulnerable consumers and under-represented groups through focus groups, interviews and collaborations with consumer associations. The main objective of this research is to understand the needs, preferences and challenges of diverse user groups to ensure the digital euro’s design is as inclusive and accessible as possible. Findings will be published in the third quarter of 2025. Continuous engagement with stakeholders remains a cornerstone of the digital euro project. The ECB has intensified its outreach to market participants, merchants and consumers through technical sessions, workshops and bilateral meetings. Particular attention has been given to how the digital euro would fit into the existing European payments ecosystem, to ensure that it complements private sector solutions. As the debate on the legislation progresses, the ECB has continued to provide technical e pertise to the European institutions involved and project updates to the euro area finance ministers (through the Eurogroup) and the European Parliament. “We are pleased to see that our efforts remain on track as we keep working to deliver on the request of EU leaders to accelerate progress on a digital euro,” said Executive Board member Piero Cipollone, who chairs the High-Level Task Force on a digital euro. “In light of today’s geopolitical and economic challenges, we welcome an ambitious pace for the legislative work.” The digital euro project is a collaborative effort between the ECB, national central banks, market participants, consumer representatives and policymakers. The ECB is committed to providing technical input to support legislative deliberations, and to ensuring that the digital euro meets the highest standards of quality, security, privacy and usability.",

The ECB’s Governing Council has already selected two possible themes for the future euro banknotes after consulting experts and the public. These are: “European culture”, focusing on shared cultural spaces and important Europeans; and “Rivers and birds”, focusing on the resilience and diversity of Europe’s natural ecosystems. In January the Governing Council also selected motifs to illustrate the two possible themes. The design contest, which is open to graphic designers residing in the European Union, aims to identify the best design proposals for the future euro banknotes. The contest will proceed in two phases: an application phase and a design proposal phase. During the application phase, designers must meet the specific requirements listed in the contest notice. The applicants will be assessed on the basis of their qualifications and achievements. Selected designers will be invited to participate in the second phase and submit their design proposals. A group of independent experts – the Design Contest Jury – will evaluate the proposals and select up to five per theme. “The euro is more than a currency – it symbolises European unity and diversity. Through this contest, we invite designers across Europe to shape the future of our banknotes to reflect our shared cultural identity and natural heritage,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde. After the contest finishes, the public will be invited to provide feedback on the designs selected. The Governing Council is e pected to decide on the final design by the end of 2026. The new banknotes will be ready to enter circulation some years after this decision and following the production process. For detailed information about the contest, please refer to the ECB’s website and the Official Journal of the European Union . Designers interested in participating are invited to submit their application by 12:00 CET on 18 August.",

      "content": "SPEECH The digital euro: legal tender in the digital age Introductory statement by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Brussels, 14 July 2025 Thank you for inviting me to take part in this e change of views. I would like to talk about why we need the digital euro – and the cost of not pursuing it. My message is simple. The main reason for issuing a digital euro is to preserve the benefits of cash in the digital era. To do so, we need to complement physical cash with a digital form of cash. The inability to use physical cash in online transactions or for digital payments at the point of sale deprives us of a key payment option, reducing resilience, competition, sovereignty and, ultimately, consumers’ freedom to choose how to pay. This increases the risks that European consumers, merchants and policymakers face. For a growing number of their transactions, Europeans lack access to central bank money – the money that is backed by the sovereign and has legal tender status, underpinning our monetary union because it is accepted everywhere in the euro area. Monetary sovereignty and people’s freedom to pay with legal tender: two sides of the same coin The Eurosystem is committed to cash and will continue to issue it. [ 1 ] But people’s habits are shifting towards digital payments. As the role of online payments has grown, the role of cash in day-to-day transactions has been declining at pace: between 2019 and 2024 its share fell from 68% to 40% in volume terms and from 40% to 24% in value terms. [ 2 ] This has two important implications. First, the role of cash will be significantly reduced if we do not provide a digital equivalent. If we fail to act, we will fail to fulfil our responsibility as a central bank towards the people we serve. Second, our monetary sovereignty is eroding. People’s ability to pay across the euro area with sovereign money – cash – and frequently choosing to do so, is a key pillar of monetary sovereignty. A digital form of cash would protect our sovereignty and ensure our monetary union is also a digital monetary union. What’s particularly concerning in Europe is that the gap left by declining cash use is being filled by non-European payment solutions. For card payments, only seven out of the 20 euro area countries have a national card scheme. These card schemes cannot be used in other euro area countries and are also losing market share domestically. For e-commerce, European-owned solutions are prevalent in only three euro area countries. [ 3 ] Strengthening our legal tender to stop the erosion of our monetary sovereignty To address this situation, the Single Currency Package protects the rights of those who want to continue to pay with cash, while complementing physical cash with a digital form of the legal tender: the digital euro. I believe we are being presented with a false choice: a private pan-euro area payment solution or a public one. First, it is not just about payments; it is about the evolution of the money. And second, it is a historical fact that state-issued money and money issued by private parties have typically coe isted, reinforcing each other. [ 4 ] The cost of inaction Since the start of the euro, we have recognised the need for an integrated retail payments market. This prompted the development of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to harmonise bank transfers. However, SEPA does not cover key use cases such as payments at the point of sale. Over the years, private firms have made several attempts to create a pan-European payment solution, but difficulties in coordinating among market participants prevented those firms from delivering a scalable and unified system. [ 5 ] Some 25 years after the launch of the euro, we still have no European payment solution that allows people to pay digitally throughout the euro area in stores, for e‑commerce goods and services and from person to person. Let us take a leap of faith. Imagine things would be different this time and that banks would manage to work together to rapidly provide a pan-European private payment solution. Would it still make sense to have the digital euro? The answer is yes. First, the digital euro would help preserve money as a public good that is easily accessible to everyone and universally accepted across the euro area. By contrast, private money belongs to the competitive space, so we cannot guarantee its acceptance by all merchants. Second, the digital euro would enhance resilience. We would have a reliable fallback in times of crisis, complementing cash. An especially important feature is that the digital euro would also function offline, providing a secure payment method even without an internet connection. [ 6 ] Moreover, as is the case with cash, we would be sure that all components of the digital euro remain in European hands. Third, the digital euro would prevent market concentration. The availability of legal tender and its wide adoption would put merchants in a stronger position to negotiate fees. In addition, the digital euro would create open standards with a wide acceptance network, making it easier for payment service providers to scale up their solutions. This would result in greater competition and innovation at European level. [ 7 ] Conclusion Let me conclude. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union entrusts you, the co-legislators, to “lay down the measures necessary for the use of the euro as the single currency.” We can together ensure that our currency is fit for the digital age by complementing physical cash and private payment initiatives with digital cash. Indeed, the digital euro is key to preserving the benefits of cash in the digital era. Cash as legal tender is a cornerstone of public trust in currencies, including the euro. It supports the stability of our currency and the effectiveness of our monetary policy. P. Cipollone (2025), “ The role of the digital euro in digital payments and finance ”, contribution to Bancaria based on remarks at the Crypto Asset Lab Conference on 17 January 2025, 28 February. These are Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal. G10 central banks have stated: “the composite of central and commercial bank money, convertible at par, is essential to the safety and efficiency of the financial system and should remain the basis of the singleness of the currency” (see Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (2003), The role of central bank money in payment systems , Bank for International Settlements, August). The e ample of instant payments shows that, despite advances in regulation and technology, the market has failed to deliver a scalable solution due to problems in coordinating among market participants. Also, the European Payments Council and industry groups have worked on common standards (e.g. SEPA Cards Framework), but no concrete unification of card networks has materialised. This contrasts with a historical e ample of ensuring resilience. Between 1964 and 1988 it was a state secret that the Bundesbank held 15 billion Deutsche Marks in substitute currency in the Cochem bunker. The Deutsche Mark had by then established its credibility as an international currency. Germany feared that counterfeit money could be smuggled into the country in large quantities in order to undermine confidence in the Deutsche Mark and bring down the economy. Had this happened, the substitute currency would have been distributed to ensure the continuity of everyday commerce. The digital euro rulebook would mandate common standards across the euro area. The digital euro acceptance standards would be made available for free to private parties, who would be able to use them as a basis for developing their services. This would help private providers achieve pan-European acceptance on a technical level, leading to cost efficiencies and a more integrated European payment market. The e pansion of both their geographical reach and their portfolio of products would, in turn, make it easier for them to compete internationally. While technical acceptance would be guaranteed, commercial agreements would still be needed. For more information, see Cipollone, P. (2025), “ Update on the work of the digital euro Rulebook Development Group ”, letter to Aurore Lalucq, Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, 9 April.",

      "content": "INTERVIEW Interview with Econostream Media Interview with Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by David Barwick and Marta Vilar on 9 July July 2025 Ms Schnabel, abstracting from the still-open question of tariffs, would you say that developments since 5 June support the idea that the ECB is in a good place, weakening the case for another move? Yes, we are in a good place. Disinflation is proceeding broadly as e pected, even if services inflation and food inflation remain somewhat elevated. We are now close to having successfully tackled past inflation shocks, which is good news. Over the medium term, inflation is projected to be at 2% and inflation expectations are well anchored. In view of this, our interest rates are also in a good place, and the bar for another rate cut is very high. Let me e plain. First, I see no risk of a sustained undershooting of inflation over the medium term. Core inflation is projected to be at target over the entire projection horizon. The low energy price inflation is likely to be temporary, and the fear of the e change rate appreciation putting downward pressure on underlying inflation is e aggerated in my view, as the pass-through is likely to be limited. In fact, this appreciation also reflects the new growth narrative in Europe, meaning there is a positive confidence effect, which attracts capital and lowers financing costs. Second, the economy is proving resilient. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2025 was better than e pected. Sentiment indicators have also surprised to the upside – the composite Purchasing Managers’ Inde rose again in June. And it’s noteworthy that manufacturing has continued to improve, with, strikingly, all the forward-looking indicators having continued their upward trend – new orders, new e port orders, future output are all at three-year highs. This suggests that we’re seeing more than just frontloading. Moreover, the labour market remains resilient, with unemployment at a record low and employment continuing to grow. It seems that the uncertainty is weighing less on economic activity than we thought, and on top of that, we’re e pecting a large fiscal impulse that will further support the economy. So overall, the risks to the growth outlook in the euro area are now more balanced. It sounds like you see no grounds for the ECB to seriously consider further easing, even if it were to wait before moving again. There would only be a case for another rate cut if we saw signs of a material deviation of inflation from our target over the medium term. And at the moment, I see no signs of that. Is the potential cost of an unnecessary cut high enough to outweigh risk management arguments for a so-called insurance cut? I don’t think that risk management considerations can justify another rate cut. Domestic inflation is still elevated and inflation expectations of households and firms are tilted to the upside. Additionally, a more fragmented global economy and a large fiscal impulse pose upside risks to the inflation outlook over the medium term. Therefore, from today’s perspective, a further rate cut is not appropriate. I would also warn against fine-tuning monetary policy to incoming data. For e ample, it would be risky to base a monetary policy decision solely on the evolution of energy prices, because we’ve seen oil prices fluctuate between USD 60 and almost USD 80 since March alone. We should remain firmly focused on the medium term and on core inflation. This is also in line with our updated monetary policy strategy, which says that we need to be agile to recognise fundamental changes in the inflation environment, but that we can tolerate moderate deviations from target if there’s no risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. We don’t yet know the final tariff outcome, but observers e pect Europe to get away with a general 10%, along with individual tariffs on certain sectors and some e ceptions for others. If you share this view, what impact on growth and inflation do you e pect? Indeed, it looks like tariff negotiations are moving towards our baseline scenario. But of course, there remains uncertainty about the outcome of the negotiations. Tariffs have a dampening effect on economic activity in the short run. However, if the negotiations are concluded successfully, this will lower uncertainty, which would support consumption and investment. As regards inflation, I see a net inflationary effect over the medium term, because the dampening effect from a weaker global economy and potential trade diversion is likely to be offset – or even overcompensated – by supply-side effects, which are not included in our standard projection models. This includes cost-push shocks rippling through global value chains, supply chain disruptions and the loss of efficiency from a more fragmented world. You said the bar for another rate cut is very high. Is that because we’re approaching accommodative territory? Or are we already in it? I think we are becoming accommodative. If you look at the latest bank lending survey, you see 56% of banks reporting that interest rates are boosting the demand for mortgages, while only 8% say they’re holding demand back. Moreover, the natural rate of interest may have increased recently due to the historic shift in German fiscal policy. This is also reflected in financial markets, where real forward rates have moved up, which reflects the e pected higher demand for capital, including from the private sector. That means that, for a given level of the policy rate, our policy becomes more accommodative. And this is what’s also reflected in the pick-up in bank lending. What other indicators do you rely on to gauge your level of accommodation? We look at general economic developments, which also reflect the restrictiveness of our monetary policy. And as I said, the economy has proven more resilient than we had thought. You described the pass-through of the EUR/USD e change rate as limited. Can you be more specific? Is there a point at which this suddenly changes? I find the debate about the e change rate appreciation e aggerated. I do not remember people having a similar concern when the e change rate was moving towards parity in early 2025. And this did not prevent us from cutting rates further. If you take a longer perspective and look at the past two decades, we’ve had comparable or even larger appreciations with a rather limited impact on inflation. There are reasons to believe that the pass-through may be limited this time as well, especially to underlying inflation. First, the source of the shock matters. In this case, the stronger e change rate is also a reflection of a positive confidence effect and investors’ belief that the euro area’s growth potential may be higher than thought. Moreover, you see a rebalancing of investors into the euro area, which tends to lower financing costs, counteracting the tightening effect of the e change rate. Second, more than half of our imports are invoiced in euro, which reduces the pass-through. Firms may also use the occasion of lower import costs to protect their profit margins rather than pass these lower costs on to consumers. Finally, the impact of the e change rate on competitiveness and foreign demand is mitigated by the high import content of our e ports. But to get back to your second question, we do not target the e change rate and we do not respond to any particular e change rate level. E change rates enter our projection models via the assumptions, and we know that they can change in either direction at any point. So further appreciation is manageable indefinitely, as long as it remains reasonably gradual? We always have to monitor what is happening. I don’t like to make very general statements about what could happen. At the moment, it’s manageable. You recently said that the estimate of the impact of higher fiscal spending incorporated into the projections is “relatively conservative”. What’s being underappreciated? Is it the timing? The composition of the spending? I see several aspects. The first is indeed timing. We’ve been positively surprised by the frontloading of spending plans by the German government. It seems they’re determined to deliver on their promises. The second aspect is fiscal multipliers. They could be higher than assumed depending on how the money is spent. Generally, they tend to be higher when the money is spent for investment. And the details of defence e penditures also matter: what share is going to be sourced domestically, and what share is used for R&D-related e penditures? A third, very important point is that our models may not fully capture the complementarity between public and private investment – that is, that private investment is being crowded in by public investment. Just recently, a group of large German corporations announced that they are planning a large investment programme, which would amplify the positive effect of public spending. How much potential do you see for a stronger-than-anticipated fiscal impulse to alter the inflation outlook and thus your policy calibration in the second half of this year? The fiscal measures are going to play out mainly over the medium term, not the short term. But inflation could eventually pick up if the economy hits capacity constraints, also due to demographic developments, which will accelerate over the coming years. Your remarks seem to confirm that the ECB is not unhappy about the fact that the US dollar has been weak. Do you see a risk that the public discussion could provoke a US reaction the ECB needs to worry about? The current situation risks undermining the e orbitant privilege of the US dollar, a privilege the United States has enjoyed over many decades, which has led to lower financing costs for American households, firms and the government. This offers a historical chance for the euro area to foster the international role of the euro as a global reserve, invoicing and funding currency, to reap some of those benefits. But there are three important prerequisites. The first is a revival of euro area growth. The second is safeguarding the rule of law and security, including in military terms. And the third is a large and liquid EU bond market. On the savings and investment union, how can the ECB – while staying within its mandate – play a stronger role in highlighting how structural inefficiencies in cross-border capital flows impede monetary policy transmission and private risk sharing? We’ve been very vocal about the savings and investment union. The President has given several speeches and the Governing Council has issued its own communication on the topic. This is because integration is closely related to our mandate. Our monetary policy is more effective in an integrated market. Integration improves monetary policy transmission by increasing private risk sharing and fostering convergence. This is firmly within our mandate. But let me also stress that the savings and investment union is about more than financial integration. It’s about fostering innovation and economic growth. This concerns not just the availability of capital, especially risk capital, but also the possibility for firms to scale up within the Single Market. We know that the internal hurdles within the Single Market are very high – some estimates show they’re much higher than the tariffs that we may be facing from the United States. So, one important part of the savings and investment union is to reduce these barriers within the Single Market. I think the 28th regime for innovative companies is a very promising proposal to allow those companies to scale up easily all over Europe. The ECB can only inform the debate through speeches and analysis, but in the end, progress will depend on the political will of governments. Back to the United States, where Donald Trump is calling daily on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign. In the past 24 hours, we’ve had new speculation about who the next Fed Chair might be. Even if Powell stays to the end of his term, there could be an announcement long before that, and his intended successor may start to make public pronouncements about his intentions that lead to market repricing and an even stronger euro. Does this worry you – and more broadly, are you concerned about any other changes that could disadvantage Europe if a more “Trumpy” Fed Chair emerges? The current discussion is testimony to the importance of central bank independence, and the Federal Reserve is leading by e ample. It’s very dangerous when you have direct interference by governments in monetary policy, because this can destroy the trust that has been built over decades. One concrete advantage of independence is that it reduces risk premia. By challenging Fed independence, risk premia may move up, which would increase rather than lower interest rates. Overall, I would never underestimate the institutional resilience of the Fed, so I remain optimistic. Does this optimism also reflect the fact that you just had the opportunity to speak with Chair Powell at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Sintra, Portugal? Absolutely. As e cess liquidity continues to decline, are you observing any emerging signs of segmentation, whether across jurisdictions or across bank tiers, in the transmission of short-term interest rates? There are no signs of segmentation. In fact, with quantitative tightening (QT) proceeding, market functioning has improved because collateral scarcity has gone down. Our new operational framework can deal very well with the heterogeneity across the euro area. Any bank can access our operations at any time, at the same rate, for the amount that they need, based on a broad set of eligible collateral. So far, the banks’ recourse to our operations has been rather limited because e cess liquidity is still abundant, and that is also reflected in market funding being more favourable than our operations. Over time, e cess liquidity is going to go down, and eventually the situation will change and more and more banks will access our operations. We are observing that process very carefully. Even if market function still appears smooth, are there any early indicators you’re watching especially closely? We are closely monitoring the functioning of money markets, and we have a whole range of indicators for that, but at the moment, we don’t have any concerns. On a related subject, as balance sheet reduction continues, do you see any risk that at some point it could impair monetary policy transmission or disrupt market functioning? Not at all. It’s important to understand the functioning of our operational framework, which is designed in a way that ensures smooth monetary policy transmission. In line with our decision, the monetary policy bond portfolios under the asset purchase programme (APP) and the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) are going to be run down to zero. At some point, once the ECB balance sheet is growing again, we will provide a significant part of banks’ structural liquidity needs via structural operations, namely longer-term lending operations and a structural bond portfolio. But these are distinct from quantitative easing (QE), which remains a tool for e ceptional circumstances that is going to be used more sparingly in the future. With sovereign spreads generally contained for now, do you view the current pace of the APP rundown as appropriate? Yes. It’s running smoothly in the background and our e perience with our gradual and predictable approach has been very positive. What could trigger a change in the pace? To change the pace of QT, you would need to have a monetary policy argument. And we said that our unconventional tools are to be used when we are near the effective lower bound, based on a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. This is not our situation today. Hence, the plan is to run down the monetary policy bond portfolios to zero. The provision of liquidity for the implementation of our monetary policy won’t be done via QE – which is a stance instrument – but rather via our weekly lending operations and, at a later stage, the structural operations, once e cess liquidity has declined to the point where demand for additional central bank liquidity begins to rise. The time lag between the cut-off date for the technical assumptions and the publication of the projections is quite long, and in this volatile world it seems that this delay could compromise the reliability of the projections. Is this approach still justified? This lag is mainly due to organisational reasons, especially when we are running the projection e ercise together with the entire Eurosystem. There is a huge machinery to be managed, with many people to be coordinated, and the outcome then has to be incorporated into the material sent to the Governing Council. The timelines are already very tight. But more fundamentally, your question reveals a common misunderstanding about our projections. In the strategy assessment, we stressed the importance of the uncertainty surrounding our baseline projections. This uncertainty stems from the assumptions, and it also comes from more fundamental uncertainty, like the outcome of tariff negotiations. But it’s a mistake to focus only on the point estimates. What the projections give you is not just this number – which is almost certainly wrong and may change from day to day – but a range of plausible outcomes. This range is what we should focus on, because the point estimates alone may be misleading if you do not also consider the uncertainty. To what e tent is the return to 2% inflation in 2027 contingent on regulatory measures like the EU’s new emissions trading system ETS2, and does this raise credibility risks if those inputs prove unreliable? In general, projecting energy prices is complicated. We are using futures prices in our staff projections even though they are not necessarily a good predictor of energy prices. Here we have an additional complication in that the new ETS has its own uncertainties, such as when it will come and how large its effects are going to be. And this brings me back to the point that we should focus on core inflation, acknowledging that whatever happens with respect to energy – as we’ve seen in the recent inflation surge – may feed into core inflation, especially when prices rise. In concluding the strategy assessment, the ECB committed to act forcefully or persistently in response to large, sustained inflation deviations. What criteria would lead you to conclude that it’s appropriate to act forcefully or persistently? The strategy assessment implies that we can tolerate moderate deviations from our inflation target as long as inflation expectations are firmly anchored. But when we see a risk of a sustained deviation from the target in either direction that could de-anchor inflation expectations, we will act appropriately forcefully or persistently, depending on the situation at hand and based on a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. What this means is that first, we have to be agile in order to detect a fundamental shift in the inflation environment. We were lacking this agility at the time of the recent inflation surge, as it took us some time to recognise that we had shifted very quickly from a low-inflation environment to a high-inflation one. We want to be more agile to be able to react to such a change more rapidly. Second, we have to pay a lot of attention to inflation expectations – not just market-based inflation expectations, because these may be subject to a “monkey-in-the-mirror” problem and may merely reflect our own thinking. It’s important to look at a broad set of indicators, including household and firm inflation expectations. And in fact, if you look at the Consumer E pectations Survey, you see that household inflation expectations reacted relatively early to the change in the inflation environment. So, this can give us useful signals. And the word “sustained” means e tending into the medium term? I’m always talking about the medium term, as this is what matters for our monetary policy. But sustained means that it’s not just temporary, and we all know that it’s difficult to judge whether something is temporary or not, but we will have to deal with that in the future. In the wake of the strategy assessment, does anything change about the weights you attach to model-based outputs, your judgement or real-time indicators? What I think is changing is our approach to data dependence. Over the past few years, data dependence played a very important role: the incoming data served as a cross-check to verify whether the data were in line with the projected decline in inflation over time. This allowed us to cut interest rates at a time when domestic inflation was still elevated. Now we’ve entered a new phase in which we are using incoming data to assess whether there could be a sustained deviation of inflation from target over the medium term. Scenario analysis helps us to navigate the uncertainty that we are facing, and the incoming data can tell us which scenario is most likely to materialise. Of course, projection models have their shortcomings, and we have to continuously improve the models, as we’ve done over recent years. For e ample, in our analysis of the impact of tariffs on economic activity, trade policy uncertainty played a very important role, but now we’re seeing that the economy is more resilient than we e pected. This could be an indication that the impact of trade policy uncertainty is smaller than thought. Another e ample is the modelling of the supply-side effects of tariffs, which are currently not in our projection models. How do you evaluate the prospects for Germany to emerge from the economic doldrums? Germany has been facing severe structural weaknesses and a loss in competitiveness. To escape stagnation, it will have to implement growth-enhancing policies. The fiscal package is one important ingredient. But just spending money will not be enough. First, you have to make sure that the money is spent wisely, meaning on investment, not consumption. Second, the spending has to be accompanied by comprehensive structural reforms, including of the social security system, especially given demographic developments. We see a clear turnaround in sentiment in the German economy. But now the German government has to deliver. I see a chance to escape low growth, and this chance should not be wasted. So, you share the optimism e pressed by Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel earlier this week? Yes, I’m also optimistic. And with regard to the change in the German attitude towards fiscal spending, what do you think the implications are for euro area growth and inflation? Germany is in a situation in which it can e pand its government spending, because it has fiscal space. If done properly, this can help increase potential growth, which would also have positive spillovers to the rest of the euro area. This may go along with higher interest rate costs, but if potential growth increases at the same time, this is manageable. Traditionally, we’ve had the core, rather fiscally conservative countries of the euro area on the one hand, and the more fiscally rela ed periphery countries on the other. Do you see this division being blurred as a consequence of the new German fiscal attitude? Germany is in a very different position from countries like France and Italy. Those countries are facing much more difficult decisions. When they want to increase defence spending as foreseen, they will have to reduce their spending elsewhere, which is politically very demanding. So, I think the difference in the fiscal situations is still there. When you speak publicly, how do you balance your own preferences and own views with the need to represent the ECB and its institutional interests? One always has to strike the right balance, but I believe that the transparency about the diversity of views within the Governing Council is a feature, not a bug. It enhances our credibility. It also helps market participants better understand the discussions in the Governing Council and detect certain shifts in policies before the decision has been taken. That ultimately helps the transmission of our monetary policy. I have always been loyal to our collegial decisions, and I try to e plain their rationale in public. But of course, when I see important new narratives that are relevant for the monetary policy discussion, I e press my views. I e plain them in comprehensive speeches based on empirical analysis, and I hope that that helps the debate.",

      "content": "SPEECH Shifting payment landscape: what a digital euro will bring Speech by Piero Cipollone, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Banka Slovenije Ljubljana, 10 July 2025 It is a pleasure to speak to you today. The ongoing shift in the way we pay is affecting the fundamental fabric of our economies. Whether we are consumers browsing digital marketplaces, entrepreneurs pursuing digital innovation, or decision-makers facing the digital transition, we are all involved in reshaping payments. Payments are more than a means of settling transactions, they are the lifeblood of a modern economy. And in a digital world, our economies will only be as competitive, inclusive, autonomous and resilient as our payments are. Slovenia has put the digital transformation at the heart of its economic strategy, aiming to place the country among the top five most digitalised economies in Europe by 2030. [ 1 ] An innovative and striving digital payments ecosystem can play a key role in this journey. As a central bank, our responsibility is to accompany and enable this transition. We must ensure that the shift to digital payments enhances accessibility and efficiency, without creating fragmentation or new dependencies. [ 2 ] Let me be clear upfront: this does not mean abandoning cash. Cash serves us well, providing a European means of payment that is accessible, accepted throughout the euro area and continuously available. People remain attached to cash for good reasons, and we are committed to continuing to provide it. [ 3 ] In fact, we will soon start preparations for a third series of euro banknotes which will bear a new design. [ 4 ] But cash cannot be used for online payments, which represent a growing share of our day-to-day transactions. So we need to e tend its benefits to the digital sphere. By introducing a digital euro we would aim to offer a digital equivalent of cash, which preserves Europeans’ freedom to pay with sovereign money, is free for basic use, preserves privacy, fosters resilience and is accepted throughout the euro area, for any digital payment. [ 5 ] In preparing for a digital euro, we are carrying out one of our core tasks as defined in the Treaty: providing a means of payment with legal tender status and issuing money as a public good. [ 6 ] Given this fundamental role, if we were the only player in payments that did not go digital, it would be fair to question whether we would be fulfilling our mandate. By preparing for a digital euro, we are simply adapting to evolving technologies and preferences. [ 7 ] This is particularly important in a monetary union like the euro area [ 8 ] , where 25 years after the launch of the euro, we still lack a European solution that enables people to pay digitally throughout the euro area and for all types of payments. And it is especially relevant today, at a time when dependencies on non-European solutions could be weaponised. [ 9 ] A digital euro would be a public-private cooperation, with European payment service providers playing a key role in its distribution. This would allow them to retain fees and data and would also enable banks to maintain client relationships. By contrast, these relationships could be threatened by payment solutions that seek to bypass banks, such as stablecoins which are currently dominated by non-bank and non-European issuers and mostly denominated in dollars. Moreover, a digital euro would enable payment service providers to scale up and offer their solutions throughout the euro area by leveraging the digital euro’s infrastructure and acceptance network. This would remedy the current state of digital payments, which is a case in point of the situation described by Mario Draghi, namely that the fragmentation of the European market along national lines prevents European firms from being competitive on a European level, let alone globally. [ 10 ] In my remarks today, I will first explore the challenges presented by the current digital transition in payments. I will then e plain how the digital euro offers opportunities to address them. The shifting landscape for payments Slovenia offers an appealing snapshot of the transformation which is under way in many European economies. Slovenians are still deeply attached to cash: in 2024 nearly two-thirds (64%) of payments at physical locations in Slovenia were made in cash. Yet digitalisation has been advancing steadily, with the share of card payments at physical locations rising to 29% in 2024, up from 19% in 2016. [ 11 ] This development is not unique to Slovenia. Across the euro area, increasing digitalisation means that online shopping now accounts for over a third of day-to-day retail transactions, while cash payments have fallen to just 24% in value terms. This shift underscores the importance for us as central banks to not only safeguard trust in money in physical form, but increasingly in digital form too. Our robust defence of cash stems directly from our mandate to issue money that Europeans can use and access throughout the euro area for their day-to-day transactions. In fact, our work on the digital euro follows logically from our defence of cash. In a world where cash cannot be used for e-commerce transactions and where people also increasingly prefer to pay digitally at physical locations, we must provide a digital equivalent of cash. This will preserve the freedom of Europeans to pay, knowing that a digital euro will be accepted wherever they can opt to pay digitally. And it will allow merchants to reconcile their customers’ preference to pay digitally with the benefits of cash as a means of payment that protects them from e cessive fees and network disruptions. If we failed to act, we would not only be failing to fulfil our mandate, we would also risk the digital transformation reversing the progress we have made with euro cash. At present we have no sovereign and inclusive digital means of payment with legal tender status. As a result, the growing use of digital payments risks entrenching our dependency on a small number of private non-European players, subjecting our money to the kindness of strangers. This dependency already results in higher fees for merchants and the transfer of ta payers’ money – in the form of lost seigniorage – outside of Europe. So today I would like to emphasise three major challenges posed by the ongoing transformation. The first is that the increased use of digital payments results in a growing reliance on non-European payment providers, which is cause for concern. Two-thirds of card-based transactions in the euro area are processed by international schemes. Some 13 euro area countries are entirely dependent on non-European systems for payments. Slovenia is a case in point. Despite efforts to promote local schemes, the Slovenian payments ecosystem remains reliant on international card schemes, which dominate the market. This dependency on non-European payment solutions means that decisions taken outside Europe could affect European consumers’ ability to seamlessly conduct everyday digital transactions, hindering Europe’s strategic autonomy. The second challenge is the persistent fragmentation of the European payments market. Despite the clear benefits of integration, banks have not managed to unite the market. The lack of compelling commercial incentives, especially given the profitability and deep-rooted nature of national payment schemes, has discouraged investment in a pan-European solution. Additionally, coordination among banks, each with distinct interests, priorities and legacy investments, has proven difficult. And even when the infrastructure and a European scheme are in place, like the TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) infrastructure and the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme, we have not seen the emergence of pan-European instant account-to-account payment solutions at the point of sale. European providers do not have the incentive or the capacity to invest in competitive, user-friendly front-end solutions across the euro area. For e ample, Slovenia’s instant payment scheme, Flik, offers a promising user e perience across various payment situations. However, its reach remains limited because it is only available to customers of Slovenian banks, e cluding non-residents and domestic users of foreign banks. Moreover, merchant acceptance of Flik does not yet match that of traditional card payments, partly because its customer base is still limited. This reflects a vicious circle where limited acceptance discourages adoption and low adoption disincentivises acceptance by merchants. As well as reducing competition, this makes it impossible to scale up the solutions offered by payment service providers that are unable to massively invest in a European-wide acceptance network. Instead, as the use of digital payments increases, we are left with a patchwork of domestic solutions that lack the reach and scale to compete effectively across the EU – and sometimes not even at the national level. In Slovenia, Karanta, a national scheme backed by the largest domestic bank, had a market share of just 0.20% in 2024. This fragmentation is not just inefficient; it makes digital payments more e pensive and less convenient than they could be, placing an unnecessary burden on both consumers and merchants. It is estimated that merchants across the euro area pay around €3 billion every year to process international debit cards. The third challenge relates to the user e perience offered by existing solutions. In Slovenia, for e ample, consumers are forced to use multiple apps, cards and platforms to make payments, resulting in a fragmented and often frustrating e perience. These issues are not specific to Slovenia. They reflect a wider European challenge: the lack of a European-wide acceptance network for an open digital payment infrastructure that matches the reality of our increasingly digital and interconnected economies. A digital euro for everyday payments In light of these challenges, we need to ensure that the benefits of digital payments are enjoyed by all, while at the same time safeguarding our sovereignty and the trust that underpins our single currency. A digital euro would ensure that central bank money remains universally accessible for everyday transactions, not just in physical form, but also digitally. It would guarantee that citizens can pay anywhere in the euro area using a trusted, risk-free instrument issued by the Eurosystem. This is consistent with the Eurosystem’s mandate under the EU Treaties to issue the only means of payment that has legal tender status. A digital euro would be a modern e pression of monetary sovereignty. And let me say it again: the digital euro is not intended to replace cash. It would complement it. We recognise that people across the euro area, and especially in Slovenia, are strongly attached to cash. It remains a vital tool for inclusion, personal freedom and resilience. We are unwavering in our commitment to cash. At the same time, our responsibility as a central bank is to ensure that, as payments become increasingly digital, citizens can continue to benefit from the trust and security that public money provides. In the long run, maintaining a direct link to a central bank-issued means of payment that is usable at the point of sale across all use cases may be essential in preserving trust in commercial bank money. [ 12 ] Moreover, without a public digital alternative, consumers and merchants would be increasingly dependent on the terms, prices, and data practices set by a few, mostly non-European, private actors. For instance, over the past few years the average net merchant service charges in the EU have nearly doubled, despite regulatory efforts to contain them. Introducing a digital euro would provide an attractive alternative to foreign payment solutions and is the only way to ensure Europe’s monetary sovereignty. It would guarantee that the euro can always be used for digital payments anywhere in the euro area, ensuring that Europeans retain the freedom to make transactions seamlessly and securely, independent of decisions taken outside the EU. Moreover, the digital euro would address the persistent fragmentation that is hampering the retail payments market. The lack of incentives and coordination among European banks to develop a continent-wide solution for payments at the point of sale is understandable but hard to overcome, given the significant investments that are needed to challenge entrenched foreign providers, their acceptance network and their proprietary standards. Instead, national payment solutions remain dependent on non-European firms to offer a comparable in-shop payment e perience, as is the case for cross-border or tap-to-pay payments, for e ample. So, just as the introduction of euro banknotes united Europe 23 years ago and brought tangible benefits to its citizens, the digital euro has the potential to create a truly integrated digital payments landscape that preserves the two-tier payment system and the healthy equilibrium between public and private money that has served us so well for so long. [ 13 ] As central bank money, it would have legal tender status, meaning it would be accepted everywhere, instantly generating powerful network effects. Leveraging its open standards and acceptance network would give European payment providers the scale and certainty they need to innovate and e pand. This would also benefit banks who are currently losing fees and data to the dominant international payment solutions and could soon also lose deposits to stablecoins, which are dominated by non-European firms and are denominated in US dollars for 99% of their value. For European payment service providers, establishing common standards through the digital euro would enable platforms such as Flik to e tend their reach domestically and to operate across all euro area countries from the outset, just as easily as national schemes do within national borders. This would open up the market to fairer competition, forcing established players to adjust the costs they impose on merchants, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. Consumers would ultimately benefit through lower prices. We are designing the digital euro platform in such a way that it e pands the range of possible conditional payments – think of automatic reimbursements in the event of train or flight delays, for e ample. This will increase choice and stimulate innovation, leading to a richer and more user-friendly e perience for everyone. The digital euro would rely on a new settlement ledger, intended to support advanced payment functionalities, including conditional payments. Our prototyping and e perimentation have shown that such payments can be implemented by leveraging application programming interfaces – or APIs as they’re known. In recent months we have partnered with some 70 merchants, fintech companies, start-ups, banks and other payment service providers, including from Slovenia, to explore the potential of the digital euro to drive innovation. We will share our findings soon. [ 14 ] The digital euro would offer a comprehensive and smooth user e perience for consumers that covers all use cases: payments in shops, online and between individuals. It would provide integrated online and offline functionalities all while upholding the highest privacy standards. The offline functionality would offer cash-like privacy, with transaction details known only to the payer and the payee. [ 15 ] Such an all-in-one solution does not currently e ist, and its introduction would mark a significant step forward for Europe. Conclusion Let me conclude. Building an agile and robust digital payments ecosystem is essential for Europe’s digital transformation. Ignoring this task risks further fragmentation and dependencies, resulting in a less convenient and more costly payment e perience for consumers and merchants, including in Slovenia. The digital euro offers a solution: a European public good that will complement cash, ensuring trust, sovereignty, and universal access to secure, cost-free payments across the euro area. It will empower people and businesses in Slovenia and beyond to transact easily and safely, online and offline, at home and across borders. And it will allow European private payment solutions to scale up and become more competitive. Ultimately, the digital euro is more than a currency innovation – it is a public commitment to the future of Europe’s digital economy. It embodies our shared values of openness, resilience and fairness, ensuring that as our economies evolve, no one is left behind and that Europe remains in control of its monetary destiny.

      "content": "SPEECH The monetary agenda at the ECB Remarks by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the House of the Euro Brussels, 9 July 2025 My goal today in these remarks is to outline the current monetary agenda at the ECB. [ 1 ] I will start with the monetary policy stance before turning to our updated monetary policy strategy. I will then briefly discuss the euro area bond market before concluding with a monetary perspective on the digital euro project. The monetary policy stance In a recent speech, I assessed that the challenge of returning inflation to the target after the inflation surges can be considered to be largely complete. [ 2 ] The orientation now for the monetary policy stance is to make sure that the current shocks and prospective new shocks hitting the economy do not lead to medium-term deviations of inflation from our two per cent target. In terms of significant data developments in recent months, there has been a marked drop in energy prices and a substantial appreciation of the euro. These forces played an important role in the June 2025 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. In addition, the fiscal outlook has materially changed for the coming years, with the overall fiscal deficit looking set to remain above three per cent over the projection horizon. Guarding against the risk of temporary deviations from target turning into longer-term deviations was an important factor in our June decision to cut rates by 25 basis points. By supporting the pricing pressure needed to generate target-consistent inflation in the medium term, this cut helps ensure that the projected negative inflation deviation over the next eighteen months remains temporary and does not convert into a longer-term deviation of inflation from the target. Currently, there is high uncertainty about the future of the international trade system. This uncertainty e tends beyond the calibration of new tariff regimes and includes the possibility of a broader set of non-tariff barriers, a deeper intertwining of economic policies and security policies and possible revisions to the treatment of foreign portfolio investors and foreign direct investors. Especially under current conditions of high uncertainty, it is essential to remain data dependent and take a meeting-by-meeting approach in making monetary policy decisions, with no pre-commitment to any particular future rate path. In addition to observing how activity and inflation are actually behaving, data dependence also e tends to the incoming data on policy settings outside the monetary domain, since shifts in international and domestic policy regimes are highly relevant for future inflation dynamics. Our updated monetary policy strategy The emphasis on two-sided uncertainty about inflation dynamics very much reflects the analysis that underpins the recently announced update to our monetary policy strategy. [ 3 ] In addition to the geopolitical tensions outlined above, our updated monetary policy strategy statement also identified ongoing structural shifts related to digitalisation, artificial intelligence, demography, the threat to environmental sustainability and changes in the international financial system as suggesting that the inflation environment will remain uncertain and potentially more volatile, with larger target deviations in both directions, posing challenges for the conduct of monetary policy. In , our assessment is that the symmetric two per cent medium-term inflation target – which has served us well and remains unchanged - is best protected by appropriately forceful or persistent monetary policy action in response to large, sustained deviations of inflation from the target in either direction, to avoid deviations becoming entrenched through de-anchored inflation expectations. In the event of significant disinflationary shocks, the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates needs to be taken into account. In the event of significant inflationary shocks, possible non-linearities in price and wage-setting need to be taken into account. The fle ibility of the medium-term orientation recognises that the appropriate monetary policy response to a deviation of inflation from the target is conte t-specific and depends on the origin, magnitude and persistence of the deviation. Subject to maintaining anchored inflation expectations, it also allows the Governing Council in its monetary policy decisions to cater for other considerations relevant to the pursuit of price stability. The Governing Council bases its monetary policy decisions, including the evaluation of the proportionality of its decisions and potential side effects, on an integrated assessment of all relevant factors. Our updated strategy makes e plicit that our monetary policy decisions incorporate not only the most likely path for inflation and the economy but also surrounding risks and uncertainty, including through the appropriate use of scenario and sensitivity analyses. A systematic but conte t-specific approach to incorporating the surrounding risks and uncertainty can include, in addition to conducting a regular risk assessment, analysing the sensitivity of projections and policy choices to changes in the underlying technical assumptions and model parameters as well as e ploring a range of alternative scenarios, especially in relation to specific risk events. In the internal preparation of monetary policy decisions, ECB staff have conducted sensitivity and scenario analyses for many years. [ 4 ] In recent years, some of this analysis has been published: this includes scenarios related to the pandemic, the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East and trade policy uncertainty. As we implement the updated monetary policy strategy, the incorporation of risks and uncertainty will be enhanced both in the internal preparation of monetary policy decisions and, where appropriate, in the communication of our decisions. While our primary instrument is the setting of our policy rates, the Governing Council may also employ other instruments, as appropriate, to steer the monetary policy stance when the policy rates are close to the lower bound or to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. The list of “unconventional” instruments includes longer-term refinancing operations, asset purchases, negative interest rates and forward guidance. The incorporation of risks and uncertainty into monetary policy decisions also has implications for the use of such instruments. In particular, the choice, design and implementation of instruments will enable an agile response to new shocks and will appropriately reflect the intended aims, whether the calibration of the monetary policy stance or the protection of monetary policy transmission, subject to a comprehensive proportionality assessment. [ 5 ] A more resilient euro area financial architecture Our updated monetary policy strategy statement also assesses that: “A more resilient financial architecture – supported by progress on the savings and investments union, the completion of banking union and the introduction of a digital euro – would also support the effectiveness of monetary policy in this evolving environment”. It is beyond the scope of these remarks to review the full policy agenda in relation to the savings and investments union and the completion of banking union. Of course, the net gains from improving financial intermediation and financial integration depend on the scale of progress in implementing the pro-growth economic reform agenda, as laid out in the Draghi and Letta report. The European Commission’s Competitiveness Compass provides a concrete roadmap for action, and its proposals, including on simplification, should be swiftly adopted. Let me pick up on an important dimension of improving the euro area financial architecture by briefly discussing the potential value of an e panded pool of euro-denominated safe assets in making the euro area capital market more attractive for both European and global investors. [ 6 ] The bund is the highest-rated large-country national bond in the euro area. However, the stock of bunds is too small relative to the size of the euro area or the global financial system. Especially in the conte t of much smaller and less volatile spreads, other national bonds also directionally contribute to the stock of safe assets. While the residual potential volatility in spreads and the lower liquidity of these bonds ultimately put a ceiling on their contribution to the supply of safe asset supply, the overall attractiveness of the euro area bond market ultimately depends on each member state ensuring fiscal sustainability, including through the shared commitment to implement the European fiscal framework in a rigorous manner. In principle, common bonds backed by the combined fiscal capacity of the EU member states should constitute a high-grade category of safe assets. However, the current stock of such bonds is simply too small to foster the necessary liquidity and risk management services (e.g. derivative markets and repo markets) that are part and parcel of serving as a safe asset. Moreover, as it stands, the stock of supranational euro bonds is currently projected to shrink over time, in view of the scheduled repayment of the NGEU bonds and, over time, the retirement of ESM bonds as the ESM loans get repaid. There are several ways to e pand the stock of common bonds. For instance, the member countries could decide to finance investment in European public goods through more common debt. From a public finance perspective, it is natural to match European public goods with common debt in order to align the financing with the area-wide benefits of such public goods. In addition to EU-wide initiatives, there could also be scope for common issuance by sub-groups of member countries in the conte t of possible “coalition of the willing” shared investment projects. Furthermore, in order to meet the rising global demand for euro-denominated safe assets more quickly, there are a number of ways to generate a larger stock of safe assets from the current stock of national bonds. [ 7 ] For instance, Olivier Blanchard and Ángel Ubide have proposed that the “blue bond/red bond” scheme (which was originally floated in 2010) be re-e amined. [ 8 ] Under the Blanchard-Ubide proposal, each member country would ringfence a dedicated revenue stream (for e ample, a certain amount of indirect ta revenues) that could be used to service commonly issued bonds. In turn, the proceeds of issuing common bonds (blue bonds) would be deployed to purchase a given amount of the national bonds (red bonds) of each participating Member State. This mechanism would result in a larger stock of blue bonds and a lower stock of red bonds. While this type of financial reform was originally proposed during the euro area sovereign debt crisis, the conditions today are far more favourable, especially if the scale of blue bond issuance were to be calibrated in a prudent manner in order to mitigate some of the identified concerns. In particular, the Blanchard-Ubide proposal gives the e ample of a stock of blue bonds corresponding to 25 per cent of GDP. Just to illustrate the scale of the required fiscal resources to back this level of issuance: if bond yields were in the range of 2 to 4 per cent on average, the servicing of blue bond debt would require ringfenced ta revenues in the range of 0.5 to 1 per cent of GDP. While this would constitute a significant shift in the current allocation of ta revenues between national and EU levels, it would still leave ta revenues predominantly at the national level (the ratio of ta revenues to GDP in the euro area ranges from around 20 to 40 per cent). The shared payoff would be the reduction in debt servicing costs generated by the safe asset services provided by an e panded stock of common debt. An alternative and possibly complementary approach that could also deliver a larger stock of safe assets from the pool of national bonds is provided by the sovereign bond-backed securities (SBBS) proposal. This proposal envisages that financial intermediaries (whether public or private) could bundle a portfolio of national bonds and issue tranched securities, with the senior slice constituting a highly safe asset. The SBBS proposal has been studied e tensively (I chaired an ESRB report on it) and draft enabling legislation has been prepared by the European Commission. [ 9 ] Just as with the blue bond/red bond proposal, sufficient issuance scale would be required in order to foster the market liquidity needed for the senior bonds to act as highly liquid safe assets. Finally, in relation to the digital euro, our updated monetary policy strategy statement also states that introducing a digital euro would support the effectiveness of monetary policy. In particular, as I outlined in a recent speech, a digital euro could help maintain the monetary autonomy of the euro area by ensuring a direct retail role for central bank digital currency can help maintain the monetary autonomy of the euro area. [ 10 ] By supplementing physical cash with digital cash, this would improve resilience by modernising the traditional two-tier monetary system whereby both cash and bank deposits can be used as a medium of e change. This modernised system would best protect the euro’s capacity to serve as the medium of e change and unit of account. [ 11 ] According to some advocates, an alternative approach to adapting the monetary system to a digital age would be to promote stablecoins, issued and operated by private sector intermediaries. There may be some potentially valid use cases for stablecoins, especially in relation to improving the efficiency of cross-border payments, at least compared to the incumbent global payments infrastructure. However, stablecoins lack key attributes of central bank money. Among other limitations, as highlighted in the recent Annual Economic Report, by the Bank for International Settlements, the supply of stablecoins is not elastic (unlike central bank money) since their issuance is driven by upfront purchases by customers. In contrast, central bank money can be issued elastically (especially during a crisis) by lending to counterparties or through open market operations. Additionally, one-to-one parity between the value of a stablecoin and the value of a currency cannot be guaranteed under all circumstances, such that stablecoins do not protect the singleness of money. An effective medium of e change requires that the monetary system and the payments system form a symbiotic ecosystem. Currently, the euro area payments system is highly fragmented along national lines and many customers are dependent on non-European card or e-wallet providers to make payments across the euro area. By mandating acceptance of the digital euro, instant network effects would help to unify the currently-fragmented market, reducing costs for merchants and indirectly also for households. Such an area-wide fast payment system is unlikely to develop in the absence of the area-wide payment rails provided by the digital euro infrastructure. For these reasons, the digital euro is a high priority project for the Eurosystem, subject to the enabling legislation being adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.

      "content": "SPEECH Deepening our commitment to confronting the climate and nature crises Welcome address by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the International Monetary Fund OEDNE/World Bank Group EDS19 Constituency Meeting Lu embourg, 4 July 2025 We live in a dynamic and increasingly comple world. E ternal shocks have become more frequent and persistent of late, profoundly altering our economies and presenting us with a myriad of challenges. Over the past few years, we have faced the most severe pandemic since the 1920s, the most devastating conflict in Europe since the 1940s and the worst energy shock since the 1970s. [ 1 ] Meanwhile, rising geopolitical tensions are reshaping global trade patterns and prompting a reassessment of broader strategic considerations. The rapid digitalisation of our economies brings both comple challenges and immense opportunities. And the escalating climate and nature crises pose an e istential threat, jeopardising the stability and resilience of our economic system. In such an environment, we must ensure that our monetary policy strategy remains fit for purpose. To this end, we revised our strategy in 2003, updated it again in 2021 and announced the outcome of our most recent e ercise earlier this week. Monetary policy strategy Our monetary policy strategy is firmly rooted in our mandate. The ECB’s primary objective is to maintain price stability in the euro area. This remains the cornerstone of all our actions. Without prejudice to this primary objective, the Eurosystem is also obliged to support the general economic policies in the EU. [ 2 ] The encouraging news is that the fundamentals of the strategy we adopted in 2021 have proven resilient, even in the face of the shocks and challenges of the past few years. Consequently, the e ercise we have just completed can best be described as an assessment, with the core pillars of our strategy remaining unchanged. [ 3 ] Earlier this week, we confirmed that price stability is best maintained by targeting an inflation rate of two per cent over the medium term. We also recognised that our target is symmetric, meaning that our monetary policy action will be appropriately forceful or persistent in response to large, sustained deviations of inflation from the target in either direction. All tools will remain available in our toolkit. Acknowledging the increased uncertainty in the inflation environment, we reiterated that our monetary policy decisions, as well as the evaluation of their proportionality and potential side effects, are based on a comprehensive and integrated assessment of all relevant factors. The impact of nature degradation on the economy In the 2021 monetary policy strategy review, the ECB’s Governing Council recognised the significance of climate change for monetary policy. This led to the creation of a concrete climate action plan, which the ECB and the Eurosystem have made significant progress on over the past four years. [ 4 ] Given the close link between climate change and nature degradation, the 2025 assessment clarified the pivotal role of nature in our ability to fulfil our mandate. Specifically, the Governing Council committed, within its mandate, to ensuring that it fully takes into account the implications of both climate change and nature degradation for monetary policy and central banking. [ 5 ] As I have often emphasised in the past, this does not mean we are climate and nature policy makers . [ 6 ] These policies are set by governments and it is their prerogative to address the climate and nature crises. We are climate and nature policy takers. At the same time, as I will argue in more detail today, we have no option but to take the effects of the climate and nature crises into account to deliver on our monetary policy and banking supervision mandates. This being said, adding the three words “and nature degradation” to our monetary strategy statement is an important step forward. Climate refers to the statistical patterns of weather over time – a pattern that is visibly changing, with major implications for our economy. Nature, on the other hand, encompasses the entirety of Earth’s physical environment, including all living organisms. It is everything not made by humans. So, by adding “nature degradation” we have now committed to considering a vastly more comple set of factors in setting our monetary policy. [ 7 ] Considering the impact of nature degradation on our price stability mandate reflects our commitment to data and evidence-based decision-making. From a central bank perspective, nature is an asset. It provides many ecosystem services – fertile soils, pollination, timber, fish stocks, water and clean air, to name just a few – supporting sustainable economic growth and financial stability. If ecosystems deteriorate, we are essentially depreciating a vital input into our economy. [ 8 ] Let me draw a parallel with the traditional factors of production. When physical or human capital depreciates, firms and households respond by investing, as it is often far more cost-effective to sustain the capital stock than to seek substitutes, if alternatives e ist. However, our collective investment in nature remains vastly insufficient to counteract the current rate of deterioration. [ 9 ] We are not living off its rents, but we are massively eating into nature’s capital stock. Any economist knows that this is unsustainable, and everything unsustainable will end. Being able to put a clear monetary value on nature would help attract and guide investment in preservation and restoration by offering financial rewards, while also making it possible to hold those who damage ecosystems financially accountable. ECB research has shown that 72% of euro area companies depend on at least one of nature’s ecosystem services. These services are declining at a faster rate than at any time in human history. Further research by the ECB and the University of O ford’s Resilient Planet Finance Lab is looking at the risks more closely. First results indicate that 15% of the euro area economy output is at risk from water scarcity alone and over €1.3 trillion of euro area bank loans are currently e tended to sectors e posed to high water scarcity risk. [ 10 ] Even more worryingly, as our models improve and more data becomes available, estimates of the economic impact of the climate and nature crises are consistently revised upwards. [ 11 ] For e ample, according to the latest estimates from the Network for Greening the Financial System, the potential loss of global GDP if climate action falters is now projected to be three times higher than in earlier assessments from just a few years ago. [ 12 ] Nature preservation and restoration offers no shortcuts. Rebuilding natural ecosystems is a time-intensive process, much like developing physical or human capital. Improvements in soil or water quality typically do not happen overnight, and crossing critical tipping points – beyond which minor disturbances can trigger irreversible shifts in the state of an ecosystem – can effectively render the damage permanent. [ 13 ] From an economic perspective, taking preventive action to avoid lasting harm to the factors of production makes perfect sense. It seems particularly prudent since many ecosystem services have the potential to (partially) recover if not overe ploited for short-term economic gains. Waiting until tipping points are reached would, in many cases, have far more costly consequences. [ 14 ] Alongside the well-documented climate crisis [ 15 ] , there are thus clear signs that the nature crisis also poses significant risks to our economy. [ 16 ] These risks could severely affect our economy and complicate our task of maintaining price stability. Ignoring them would be tantamount to disregarding robust, fact-based evidence, which would be as indefensible as failing to consider any other threat to our price stability target. Unfortunately, given nature’s comple ity, its interaction with climate change and the current lack of robust data, we do not yet have the necessary tools to fully assess the implications of nature degradation for our mandate. By including nature degradation in our monetary policy statement we are therefore also implicitly calling for further research and improved data reporting – areas we will also contribute to. This additional work is crucial to ensure that our monetary policy is set appropriately and in a proportionate manner. Where we stand and the path ahead The challenge of nature degradation fundamentally stems from a deeply rooted market failure. Addressing this failure falls primarily within the remit of policymakers, not of central banks. However, from the perspective of our primary [ 17 ] (and secondary [ 18 ] ) mandate, along with further obligations under the EU Treaties, [ 19 ] we have a responsibility to evaluate and consider the economic implications of climate change and nature degradation, including both physical and transition risks. We are not starting from scratch. [ 20 ] Over the past three years, we have conducted and published initial research on nature-related risks, shedding preliminary light on the severity of the issue. [ 21 ] We have clarified the legal foundations for actions taken within our mandate. [ 22 ] And we recently disclosed for the first time the e posure of our corporate portfolios to potential nature-related losses. [ 23 ] Our future work plan will delve deeper into the economic, financial and monetary policy implications of nature-related risks. This will complement ongoing efforts to better understand the green transition and the physical impact of climate change. However, central banks cannot bridge this knowledge and data gap alone. In light of the macro-criticality of the climate nature crises, not only in Europe but even more so in developing and emerging economies, it is encouraging that a wide range of institutions are developing tools and taking action. [ 24 ] Institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) play a pivotal role in evaluating the implications of climate change and nature degradation, given their mandates to safeguard global macroeconomic and financial stability. We welcome the IMF’s continued efforts to enhance its surveillance activities, such as the Financial Sector Assessment Programs and Article IV consultations, as well as its deployment of financing tools like the Resilience and Sustainability Trust to bolster climate resilience and support the transition to low-carbon economies. [ 25 ] Conclusion Let me conclude. We are dedicated to making decisions on the basis of data and evidence. Therefore, within our mandate, we remain committed to ensuring that the Eurosystem fully takes into account, in line with the EU’s goals and objectives, the implications of climate change and nature degradation for monetary policy and central banking. Given the uncertainties surrounding these risks, continuous scientific input is essential to understanding the impact of the climate and nature crises on our economies. Active collaboration across institutions and borders is essential to enhance our understanding of the economic implications and to deliver on our mandate. Lagarde, C.

The Treaty prescribes that without prejudice to this primary objective, the Eurosystem is also obliged to support the general economic policies in the Union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union – including a high level of protection of the environment (Article 127(1) and Article 282(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; the objectives of the Union are laid out in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union).

For e ample, we have made significant progress in improving our capabilities to take climate considerations into account in the macroeconomic analyses that inform our monetary policy assessment. Moreover, between October 2022 and July 2023 we started tilting our reinvestments of corporate bonds towards issuers that have a better climate performance. In so doing, we can avoid undue e posures to climate-related risks that are detrimental to price stability and align the way we administer our monetary policy more closely with the EU’s general economic policies. In addition to our bond holdings, we are looking at incorporating climate risk considerations in the collateral framework that we apply in relation to banks’ participation in our lending operations. ECB (2025), “ ECB’s Governing Council updates its monetary policy strategy “, press release, 30 June. See, for e ample, Elderson, F. (2023), “ Policymakers as policy takers – accounting for climate-related and environmental factors in banking supervision and monetary policy ”, speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington DC, 21 April and Elderson, F. (2024), “ Taking into account climate and nature in monetary policy and banking supervision around the world ”, speech at an event on climate-related financial risks hosted by the Banco Central do Brasil, Rio de Janeiro, 27 March. Unlike the climate crisis – which can be quantified through carbon emissions and their direct link to rising temperatures – there is no single metric to capture the diverse range of nature’s ecosystem services. This comple ity makes incorporating nature into our mandate much more challenging; see Elderson, F. (2025), “ Nature’s bell tolls for thee, economy! ”, keynote speech at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden, 22 May. For a comprehensive assessment of the role of ecosystem services in the economy, see Kareiva, P., Tallis, H., Ricketts, T.H, Daily, G.C. and Polasky, S. (eds.) (2011), Natural capital: theory and practice of mapping ecosystem services , O ford University Press, O ford. The stock of natural capital per person declined by nearly 40% between 1992 and 2014, posing a serious threat to the prosperity of current and future generations (Dasgupta, P. (2021), The Economics of Biodiversity: The Dasgupta Review, HM Treasury, London). Nearly 15% of euro area GDP would be at risk from severe surface water shortages during a 1-in-25-year drought; see Ceglar, A., Danieli, F., Heemskerk, I., Jwaideh, M. and Ranger, N. (2025), “ The European economy is not drought-proof ”, The ECB Blog , ECB, 23 May. Moreover, the blog post states that €1.3 trillion in euro area bank lending (more than 34% of corporate loans) is to sectors e posed to high water stress. Additionally, recent empirical research by O ford University, one of the first of its kind, demonstrates that both domestic and international nature degradation could lead to an estimated 12% reduction in UK GDP in the years to come. News about biodiversity loss also matters, as it increases spreads on credit default swaps more for countries with more depleted ecosystems. A study by Blackrock also argues that markets have historically not been very good at capturing all of the value of natural capital and its services in market prices, especially when the underlying resource is shared rather than owned. For e ample, markets are relatively inefficient at attributing a price to natural wild bees and other pollinators, which are estimated to have an implicit annual global value of USD billion.

See CarbonBrief (2020), E plainer: Nine ‘tipping points’ that could be triggered by climate change , 10 February. See Lenton, T.M. et al. (eds.) (2023), The Global Tipping Points Report 2023 , University of E eter, E eter, United Kingdom. For the climate crisis, see, for instance, Munich RE (2025) “ Climate change is showing its claws: The world is getting hotter, resulting in severe hurricanes, thunderstorms and floods ”, media release , 9 January. Unlike climate, nature is far harder to quantify within a single metric, but the threats to our economy are numerous. For e ample, the degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems poses risks to global GDP of a magnitude of 3-5% (Patil, P.G. et al. (2016), Toward a Blue Economy: A Promise for Sustainable Growth in the Caribbean , World Bank). Similarly, farmland degradation is significantly undermining agricultural productivity worldwide. Pressures on farmland could reduce global food productivity by 12% and raise food prices by up to 30% by 2040 (see Noel, S. et al. (2015), Report for policy and decision makers – Reaping economic and environmental benefits from sustainable land management , Economics of Land Degradation Initiative, Bonn, Germany, and Kopittke, P.M et al. (2019), Soil and the intensification of agriculture for global food security , Environmental International, Vol. 132, November”). The scarcity of clean water is another critical issue, jeopardising agricultural output while also significantly affecting other sectors (Elderson, F. (2025), op. cit.). Declining water quality has already caused a sharp reduction in recreational visits, with estimated economic losses e ceeding €100 billion annually (see Borger et al. (2021), The value of blue-space recreation and perceived water quality across Europe: A contingent behaviour study , Science of The Total Environment, Vol. 771). The interplay between nature and climate change amplifies these challenges. For instance, the degradation of forests and wetlands diminishes their capacity for carbon sequestration (Maes, J., Teller, A., Erhard, M., Condé, S., Vallecillo, S. et al. (2020), Mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services – An EU wide ecosystem assessment in support of the EU biodiversity strategy , Publications Office of the European Union). This is clear from significant recent research. In 2022 the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) already emphasised that nature-related risks could have significant macroeconomic implications. See NGFS (2022), Statement on Nature-Related Financial Risks , Paris, 24 March. The OECD has also pointed out that sustained decreases in the supply of commodities and higher prices may lead to macroeconomic inflationary pressures. See OECD (2023), “ A supervisory framework for assessing nature-related financial risks: Identifying and navigating biodiversity risks ”, OECD Business and Finance Policy Papers , No 33, Paris, September. The European Commission has likewise noted that nature-related risk drivers can affect factors such as inflation, labour productivity and the overall economy through macroeconomic transmission channels. See Cziesielski, M. et al. (2024), Study for a methodological framework and assessment of potential financial risks associated with biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation – Final report , European Commission, Brussels, March. Addressing the impact of climate change, the carbon transition and nature degradation is a key policy priority for the European Union. Accordingly, and without prejudice to its primary mandate of price stability, the ECB is legally obligated to contribute to tackling these challenges (see the factsheet on environmental policy issued by the European Parliament ). Beyond the secondary objective, the ECB has to comply with two key transversal principles of the Treaties. Article 11 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that the EU’s environmental protection requirements must be “integrated into the definition and implementation of the Union's policies and activities”. This imposes an obligation on the ECB to take into account the EU’s policies to protect nature when shaping its own policies and performing its tasks. In addition, under Article 7 of the TFEU, the activities and policies of the ECB need to be consistent with EU law – including EU law on nature and biodiversity. O’Connell, M. (2024) “ Birth of a naturalist? Nature-related risks and biodiversity loss: legal implications for the ECB ”, ECB Legal Working Papers, No 22, June. On the supervisory front, the ECB has also taken significant steps to ensure that banks adequately manage their climate and nature related risks. Nature degradation affects banks’ balance sheets by serving as a risk driver across the traditional risk categories defined in the prudential framework. ECB Banking Supervision has acknowledged the materiality of these nature-related risks and integrated them into its supervisory engagements with banks. For instance, the ECB issued a guide for banks setting out clear supervisory expectations for identifying and managing these risks, including broader environmental challenges (see ECB (2020), Guide on climate-related and environmental risks , November). Additionally, climate and environmental risks have been identified as a key supervisory priority for the period from 2022 to 2027 (see ECB (2024), Supervisory priorities ). See Ceglar, A., Danieli, F., Heemskerk, I., Jwaideh, M. and Ranger, N. (2025), op. cit. See O’Connell, M. (2024), op. cit. and Elderson, F. (2024), “ Nature-related risk: legal implications for central banks, supervisors and financial institutions ”, keynote speech at the ESCB Legal Conference 2024, Frankfurt am Main, 6 September. See ECB (2025), “ ECB adds indicator of nature loss in climate-related financial disclosures as portfolio emissions continue to decline ”, press release , 12 June. Low-income economies are generally more reliant on nature's services than high-income economies, making them disproportionately vulnerable to the consequences of nature degradation. See Dasgupta, P. (2021), op. cit. Similarly, both the NGFS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) have advanced work on addressing nature-related risks.

      "content": "Meeting of 3-5 June 2025 Account of the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held in Frankfurt am Main on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, 3-5 June 2025 3 July 2025 1. Review of financial, economic and monetary developments and policy options Financial market developments Ms Schnabel started her presentation by noting that the narrative in financial markets remained unstable. Since January 2025 market sentiment had swung from strong confidence in US e ceptionalism to expectations of a global recession that had prevailed around the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 16-17 April, and then back to investor optimism. These developments had been mirrored by sharp swings in euro area asset markets, which had now more than recovered from the shock triggered by the US tariff announcement on 2 April. On the back of these developments, market-based measures of inflation compensation had edged up across maturities since the previous monetary policy meeting. The priced-in inflation path was currently close to 2% over the medium term, with a temporary dip below 2% seen for early 2026, largely owing to energy-related base effects. Nevertheless, expectations regarding ECB monetary policy had not recovered and remained near the levels seen immediately after 2 April. Financial market volatility had quickly declined after the spike in early April. Stock market volatility had risen sharply in the euro area and the United States in response to the US tariff announcement on 2 April, reaching levels last seen around the time of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the COVID-19 pandemic shock in 2020. However, compared with these shocks, volatility had receded much faster, returning to post-pandemic average levels. The receding volatility had been reflected in a sharp rebound in asset prices across market segments. In the euro area, risk assets had more than recovered from the heavy losses incurred after the 2 April tariff announcement. By contrast, some US market segments, notably the dollar and Treasuries, had not fully recovered from their losses. The largest price increases had been observed for bitcoin and gold. Two main drivers had led the recovery in euro area risk asset markets and the outperformance of euro area assets relative to US assets. The first had been the reassessment of the near-term macroeconomic outlook for the euro area since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting. Macroeconomic data for both the euro area and the United States had recently surprised on the upside, refuting the prospect of a looming recession for both regions. The forecasts from Consensus Economics for euro area real GDP growth in 2025, which had been revised down following the April tariff announcement, had gradually been revised up again, as the prospective economic impact of tariffs was currently seen as less severe than had initially been priced in. E pectations for growth in 2026 remained well above the 2025 forecasts. By contrast, expectations for growth in the United States in both 2025 and 2026 had been revised down much more sharply, suggesting that economic growth in the United States would be worse hit by tariffs than growth in the euro area. The second factor supporting euro area asset prices in recent months had been a growing preference among global investors for broader international diversification away from the United States. Evidence from equity funds suggested that the euro area was benefiting from global investors’ international portfolio rebalancing. The growing attractiveness of euro-denominated assets across market segments had been reflected in recent e change rate developments. Since the April tariff shock, the EUR/USD e change rate had decoupled from interest rate differentials, partly owing to a change in hedging behaviour. Historically, the euro had depreciated against the US dollar when volatility in foreign e change markets increased. Over the past three months, however, it had appreciated against the dollar when volatility had risen, suggesting that the euro – rather than the dollar – had recently served as a safe-haven currency. The outperformance of euro area markets relative to other economies had been most visible in equity prices. Euro area stocks had continued to outperform not only their US peers, but also stock indices of other major economies, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Japan. The German DA had led the euro area rally and had surpassed its pre-tariff levels to reach a new record high, driven by expectations of strengthening growth momentum following the announcement of the German fiscal package in March. Looking at the factors behind euro area stock market developments, a divergence could be observed between short-term and longer-term earnings growth expectations. Whereas, for the next 12 months, euro area firms’ e pected earnings growth had been revised down since the tariff announcement, for the next three to five years, analysts had continued to revise earnings growth expectations up. This could be due to a combination of a short-term dampening effect from tariffs and a longer-term positive impulse from fiscal policy. The recovery in risk sentiment had also been visible in corporate bond markets. The spreads of high-yielding euro area non-financial corporate bonds had more than reversed the spike triggered by the April tariff announcement. This suggested that the heightened trade policy uncertainty had not had a lasting impact on the funding conditions of euro area firms. Despite comparable funding costs on the two sides of the Atlantic, when taking into account currency risk-hedging costs, US companies had increasingly turned to euro funding. This underlined the increased attractiveness of the euro. The resilience of euro area government bond markets had been remarkable. The spread between euro area sovereign bonds and overnight inde swap (OIS) rates had narrowed visibly since the April tariff announcement. Historically, during “risk-off” periods GDP-weighted euro area government asset swap spreads had tended to widen. However, during the latest risk-off period the reaction of the GDP-weighted euro area sovereign yield curve had resembled that of the German Bund, the traditional safe haven. A decomposition of euro area and US OIS rates showed that, in the United States, the rise in longer-term OIS rates had been driven by a sharp increase in term premia, while expectations of policy rate cuts had declined. In the euro area, the decline in two-year OIS rates had been entirely driven by expectations of lower policy rates, while for longer-term rates the term premium had also fallen slightly. Hence, the reassessment of monetary policy expectations had not been the main driver of diverging interest rate dynamics on either side of the Atlantic. Instead, the key driver had been a divergence in term premia. The recent market developments had had implications for overall financial conditions. Despite the tightening pressure stemming from the stronger euro e change rate, indices of financial conditions had recovered to stand above their pre-April levels. The decline in euro area real risk-free interest rates across the entire yield curve had brought real yields below the level prevailing at the time of the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting. Inflation compensation had edged up in the euro area since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting. One-year forward inflation compensation two years ahead, e cluding tobacco, currently stood at 1.8%, i.e. only slightly below the 2% inflation target when accounting for tobacco. Over the longer term five-year forward inflation compensation five years ahead remained well anchored around 2%. The fact that near-term inflation compensation remained below the levels seen in early 2025 could largely be ascribed to the sharp drop in oil prices. In spite of the notable easing in financial conditions, the fading of financial market volatility, the pick-up in inflation expectations and positive macroeconomic surprises, investors’ expectations regarding ECB monetary policy had remained broadly unchanged. A 25 basis point cut was fully priced in for the present meeting, and another rate cut was priced in by the end of the year, with some uncertainty regarding the timing. Hence, expectations for ECB rates had proven relatively insensitive to the recovery in other market segments. The global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area Mr Lane started by noting that headline inflation had declined to 1.9% in May from 2.2% in April. Energy inflation had been unchanged at -3.6% in May. Food inflation had edged up to 3.3%, from 3.0%, while goods inflation had been stable at 0.6% in May and services inflation had declined to 3.2% in May, from 4.0% in April. Most measures of underlying inflation suggested that in the medium term inflation would settle at around the 2% target on a sustained basis, in part as a result of the continuing moderation in wage growth. The annual growth rate of negotiated wages had fallen to 2.4% in the first quarter of 2025, from 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Forward-looking wage trackers continued to point to an easing in negotiated wage growth. The Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresaw a deceleration in the annual growth rate of compensation per employee, from 4.5% in 2024 to 3.2% in 2025, and to 2.8% in 2026 and 2027. The Consumer E pectations Survey also pointed to moderating wage pressures. The short-term outlook for headline inflation had been revised down, owing to lower energy prices and the stronger euro. This was supported by market-based inflation compensation measures. The euro had appreciated strongly since early March – but had moved broadly sideways over the past few weeks. Since the April Governing Council meeting the euro had strengthened slightly against the US dollar (+0.6%) and had depreciated in nominal effective terms (-0.7%). Compared with the March projections, oil prices and oil futures had decreased substantially. As the euro had appreciated, the decline in oil prices in euro terms had become even larger than in US dollar terms. Gas prices and gas futures were also at much lower levels than at the time of the March projections. According to the baseline in the June staff projections, headline inflation – as measured by the Harmonised Inde of Consumer Prices (HICP) – was e pected to average 2.0% in 2025, 1.6% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027. Relative to the March projections, inflation had been revised down by 0.3 percentage points for both 2025 and 2026, and was unchanged for 2027. Headline inflation was e pected to remain below the target for the next one and a half years. The downward revisions mainly reflected lower energy price assumptions, as well as a stronger euro. The projected increase in inflation in 2027 incorporated an e pected temporary upward impact from climate-related fiscal measures – namely the new EU Emissions Trading System (ETS2). In the June baseline projections, core inflation (HICP inflation e cluding energy and food) was e pected to average 2.4% in 2025 and 1.9% in both 2026 and 2027. The results of the latest Survey of Monetary Analysts were broadly in line with the June projections for headline inflation in 2025 and 2027, but showed a notably less pronounced undershoot for 2026. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained at around the 2% target, which supported the sustainable return of inflation to target. At the same time, markets were pricing in an e tended phase of below-target inflation, with the one-year forward inflation-linked swap rate two years ahead and the one-year forward rate three years ahead averaging 1.8%. The frontloading of imports in anticipation of higher tariffs had contributed to stronger than e pected global trade growth in the first quarter of the year. However, high-frequency data pointed to a significant slowdown of trade in May. E cluding the euro area, global GDP growth had moderated to 0.7% in the first quarter, down from 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The global manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Inde (PMI) e cluding the euro area continued to signal stagnation, edging down to 49.6 in May, from 50.0 in April. The forward-looking PMI for new manufacturing orders remained below the neutral threshold of 50. Compared with the March projections, euro area foreign demand had been revised down by 0.4 percentage points for 2025 and by 1.4 percentage points for 2026. Growth in euro area foreign demand was e pected to decline to 2.8% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026, before recovering to 3.1% in 2027. While Eurostat’s most recent flash estimate suggested that the euro area economy had grown by 0.3% in the first quarter, an aggregation of available country data pointed to a growth rate of 0.4%. Domestic demand, e ports and inventories should all have made a positive contribution to the first quarter outturn. Economic activity had likely benefited from frontloading in anticipation of trade frictions. This was supported by anecdotal evidence from the latest Non-Financial Business Sector Dialogue held in May and by particularly strong e port and industrial production growth in some euro area countries in March. On the supply side, value-added in manufacturing appeared to have contributed to GDP growth more than services for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2023. Survey data pointed to weaker euro area growth in the second quarter amid elevated uncertainty. Uncertainty was also affecting consumer confidence: the Consumer E pectations Survey confidence indicator had dropped in April, falling to its lowest level since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, mainly because higher-income households were more responsive to changing economic conditions. A saving rate indicator based on the same survey had also increased in annual terms for the first time since October 2023, likely reflecting precautionary motives for saving. The labour market remained robust. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, employment had increased by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The unemployment rate had remained broadly unchanged since October 2024 and had stood at a record low of 6.2% in April. At the same time, demand for labour continued to moderate gradually, as reflected in a decline in the job vacancy rate and subdued employment PMIs. Workers’ perceptions of the labour market and of probabilities of finding a job had also weakened, according to the latest Consumer E pectations Survey. Trade tensions and elevated uncertainty had clouded the outlook for the euro area economy. Greater uncertainty was e pected to weigh on investment. Higher tariffs and the recent appreciation of the euro should weigh on e ports. Despite these headwinds, conditions remained in place for the euro area economy to strengthen over time. In particular, a strong labour market, rising real wages, robust private sector balance sheets and less restrictive financing conditions following the Governing Council’s past interest rate cuts should help the economy withstand the fallout from a volatile global environment. In addition, a rebound in foreign demand later in the projection horizon and the recently announced fiscal support measures were e pected to bolster growth over the medium term. In the June projections, the fiscal deficit was now e pected to be 3.1% in 2025, 3.4% in 2026 and 3.5% in 2027. The higher deficit path was mostly due to the additional fiscal package related to higher defence and infrastructure spending in Germany. The June projections foresaw annual average real GDP growth of 0.9% in 2025, 1.1% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. Relative to the March projections, the outlook for GDP growth was unchanged for 2025 and 2027 and had been revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2026. The unrevised growth projection for 2025 reflected a stronger than e pected first quarter combined with weaker prospects for the remainder of the year. In the current conte t of high uncertainty, Eurosystem staff had also assessed how different trade policies, and the level of uncertainty surrounding these policies, could affect growth and inflation under some alternative illustrative scenarios, which would be published with the staff projections on the ECB’s website. If the trade tensions were to escalate further over the coming months, staff would e pect growth and inflation to be below their baseline projections. By contrast, if the trade tensions were resolved with a benign outcome, staff would e pect growth and, to a lesser e tent, inflation to be higher than in the baseline projections. Turning to monetary and financial conditions, risk-free interest rates had remained broadly unchanged since the April meeting. Equity prices had risen and corporate bond spreads had narrowed in response to better trade news. While global risk sentiment had improved, the euro had stayed close to the level it had reached as a result of the deepening of trade and financial tensions in April. At the same time, sentiment in financial markets remained fragile, especially as suspensions of higher US tariff rates were set to e pire starting in early July. Lower policy rates continued to be transmitted to lending conditions for firms and households. The average interest rate on new loans to firms had declined to 3.8% in April, from 3.9% in March, with the cost of issuing market-based debt unchanged at 3.7%. Consistent with these patterns, bank lending to firms had continued to strengthen gradually, growing by an annual rate of 2.6% in April, after 2.4% in March, while corporate bond issuance had been subdued. The average interest rate on new mortgages had stayed at 3.3% in April, while growth in mortgage lending had increased to 1.9%, from 1.7% in March. Annual growth in broad money, as measured by M3, had picked up in April to 3.9%, from 3.7% in March. Monetary policy considerations and policy options In summary, inflation was currently at around the 2% target. While this in part reflected falling energy prices, most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at this level on a sustained basis in the medium term. This medium-term outlook was underpinned by the e pected continuing moderation in services inflation as wage growth decelerated. The current indications were that rising barriers to global trade would likely have a disinflationary impact on the euro area in 2025 and 2026, as reflected in the June baseline and the staff scenarios. However, the possibility that a deterioration in trade relations would put upward pressure on inflation through supply chain disruptions required careful ongoing monitoring. Under the baseline, only a limited revision was seen to the path of GDP growth, but the headwinds to activity would be stronger under the severe scenario. Broadly speaking, monetary transmission was proceeding smoothly, although high uncertainty reduced its strength. Based on this assessment, Mr Lane proposed lowering the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, taking the deposit facility rate to 2.0%. The June projections were conditioned on a rate path that included a one-quarter of a percentage point reduction in the deposit facility rate in June. By supporting the pricing pressure needed to generate target-consistent inflation in the medium term, this cut would help ensure that the projected deviation of inflation below the target in remained temporary and did not turn into a longer-term deviation. By demonstrating that the Governing Council was determined to make sure that inflation returned to target in the medium term, the rate reduction would help underpin inflation expectations and avoid an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions. The proposal was also robust across the different trade policy scenarios prepared by staff. 2. Governing Council’s discussion and monetary policy decisions Economic, monetary and financial analyses On the global environment, growth in the world economy (outside the euro area) was e pected to slow in 2025 and 2026 compared with 2024. This slowdown reflected developments in the United States – although China would also be affected – and would result in slower growth in euro area foreign demand. These developments were seen to stem mainly from trade policy measures enacted by the US Administration and reactions from China and other countries. Members underlined that the outlook for the global economy remained highly uncertain. Elevated trade uncertainty was likely to prevail for some time and could broaden and intensify, beyond the most recent announcements of tariffs on steel and aluminium. Further tariffs could increase trade tensions, as well as the likelihood of retaliatory actions and the prospect of non-linear effects, as retaliation would increasingly affect intermediate goods. While high-frequency trackers of global economic activity and trade had remained relatively resilient in the first quarter of 2025 (partly reflecting frontloading), indicators for April and May already suggested some slowdown. The euro had appreciated in nominal effective terms since the March 2025 projection e ercise, although not by as much as it had strengthened against the US dollar. Another noteworthy development was the sharp decline in energy commodity prices, with both crude oil and natural gas prices now e pected to be substantially lower than foreseen in the March projections (on the basis of futures prices). Developments in energy prices and the e change rate were seen as the main drivers of the dynamics of euro area headline inflation at present. Members e tensively discussed the trade scenarios prepared by Eurosystem staff in the conte t of the June projection e ercise. Such scenarios should assist in identifying the relevant channels at work and could provide a quantification of the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty on growth, the labour market and inflation, in conjunction with regular sensitivity analyses. The baseline assumption of the June 2025 projection e ercise was that tariffs would remain at the May 2025 level over the projection horizon and that uncertainty would remain elevated, though gradually declining. Recognising the high level of uncertainty currently surrounding US trade policies, two alternative scenarios had been considered for illustrative purposes. One was a “mild” scenario of lower tariffs, incorporating the “zero-for-zero” tariff proposal for industrial goods put forward by the European Commission and a faster reduction in trade policy uncertainty. The other was a “severe” scenario which assumed that tariffs would revert to the higher levels announced in April and also included retaliation by the EU, with trade policy uncertainty remaining elevated. In the first instance, it was underlined that the probability that could be attached to the baseline projection materialising was lower than in normal times. Accordingly, a higher probability had to be attached to alternative possible outcomes, including potential non-linearities entailed in jumping from one scenario to another, and the baseline provided less guidance than usual. Mi ed views were e pressed, however, on the likelihood of the scenarios and on which would be the most relevant channels. On the one hand, the mild scenario was regarded as useful to demonstrate the benefits of freeing trade rather than restricting it. However, at the current juncture there was relatively little confidence that it would materialise. Regarding the severe scenario, the discussion did not centre on its degree of severity but rather on whether it adequately captured the possible adverse ramifications of substantially higher tariffs. One source of additional stress was related to dislocations in financial markets. Moreover, downward pressure on inflation could be amplified if countries with overcapacity rerouted their e ports to the euro area. More pressure could come from energy prices falling further and the euro appreciating more strongly. It was remarked that in all the scenarios, the main impact on activity and inflation appeared to stem from higher policy uncertainty rather than from the direct impact of higher tariffs. A third focus of the discussion regarded possible adverse supply-side effects. The argument was made that the scenarios presented in the staff projections were likely to underestimate the upside risks to inflation, because tariffs were modelled as a negative demand shock, while supply-side effects were not taken into account. While it was noted that, thus far, no significant broad-based supply-side disturbances had materialised, restrictions on trade in rare earths were cited as an e ample of adverse supply chain effects that had already occurred. Moreover, the e periences after the pandemic and after Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine served as cautionary reminders that supply-side effects, if and when they occurred, could be non-linear in nature and impact. In this respect, potential short-term supply chain disruptions needed to be distinguished from longer-term trends such as deglobalisation. Reference was made to an Occasional Paper published in December 2024 on trade fragmentation entitled “Navigating a fragmenting global trading system: insights for central banks”, which had considered the implications of a splitting of trading blocs between the East and the West. While such detailed sectoral analysis could serve as a useful “satellite model”, it was not part of the standard macroeconomic toolkit underpinning the projections. At the same time, it was noted that large supply-side effects from trade fragmentation could themselves trigger negative demand effects. Against this background, it was argued that retaliatory tariffs and non-linear effects of tariffs on the supply side of the economy, including through structural disruption and fragmentation of global supply chains, might spur inflationary pressures. In particular, inflation could be higher than in the baseline in the short run if the EU took retaliatory measures following an escalation of the tariff war by the United States, and if tariffs were imposed on products that were not easily substitutable, such as intermediate goods. In such a scenario, tariffs and countermeasures could ripple through the global economy via global supply chains. Firms suffering from rising costs of imported inputs would over time likely pass these costs on to consumers, as the previous erosion of profit margins made cost absorption difficult. Over the longer term a reconfiguration of global supply chains would probably make production less efficient, thereby reversing earlier gains from globalisation. As a result, the inflationary effects of tariffs on the supply side could outweigh the disinflationary pressure from reduced foreign demand and therefore pose upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook. With regard to euro area activity, the economy had proven more resilient in the first quarter of 2025 than had been e pected, but the outlook remained challenging. Preliminary estimates of euro area real GDP growth in the first quarter suggested that it had not only been stronger than previously anticipated but also broader-based, and recent updates based on the aggregation of selected available country data suggested that there could be a further upward revision. Frontloading of activity and trade ahead of prospective tariffs had likely played a significant role in the stronger than e pected outturn in the first quarter, but the broad-based e pansion was a positive signal, with data suggesting growth in most demand components, including private consumption and investment. In particular, attention was drawn to the likely positive contribution from investment, which had been e pected to be more adversely affected by trade policy uncertainty. It was also felt that the underlying fundamentals of the euro area were in a good state, and would support economic growth in the period ahead. Notably, higher real incomes and the robust labour market would allow households to spend more. Rising government investment in infrastructure and defence would also support growth, particularly in 2026 and 2027. These solid foundations for domestic demand should help to make the euro area economy more resilient to e ternal shocks. At the same time, economic growth was e pected to be more subdued in the second and third quarters of 2025. This assessment reflected in part the assumed unwinding of the frontloading that had occurred in the first quarter, the implementation of some of the previously announced trade restrictions and ongoing uncertainty about future trade policies. Indeed, recent real-time indicators for the second quarter appeared to confirm the e pected slowdown. Composite PMI data for April and May pointed to a moderation, both in current activity and in more forward-looking indicators, such as new orders. It was noted that a novel feature of the latest survey data was that manufacturing indicators were above those for services. In fact, the manufacturing sector continued to show signs of a recovery, in spite of trade policy uncertainty, with the manufacturing PMI standing at its highest level since August 2022. The PMIs for manufacturing output and new orders had been in e pansionary territory for three months in a row and expectations regarding future output were at their highest level for more than three years. While this was viewed as a positive development, it partly reflected a temporary boost to manufacturing, stemming from frontloading of e ports, which masked potential headwinds for e porting firms in the months ahead that would be further reinforced by a stronger euro. While there was considerable volatility in e port developments at present, the e pected profile over the entire projection horizon had been revised down substantially in the past two projection e ercises. In addition, ongoing high uncertainty and trade policy unpredictability were e pected to weigh on investment. Furthermore, the decline in services indicators was suggestive of the toll that trade policy uncertainty was taking on economic sentiment more broadly. Overall, estimates for GDP growth in the near term suggested a significant slowdown in growth dynamics and pointed to broadly flat economic activity in the middle of the year. Looking ahead, broad agreement was e pressed with the June 2025 Eurosystem staff projections for growth, although it was felt that the outlook was more clouded than usual as a result of current trade policy developments. It was noted that stronger than previously e pected growth around the turn of the year had provided a marked boost to the annual growth figure, with staff e pecting an average of 0.9% for 2025. However, it was observed that the unrevised projection for 2025 as a whole concealed a stronger than previously anticipated start to the year but a weaker than previously projected middle part of the year. Thus, the e pected pick-up in growth to 1.1% in 2026 also masked an anticipated slowdown in the middle of 2025. Staff e pected growth to increase further to 1.3% in 2027. Some scepticism was e pressed regarding the much stronger quarterly growth rates foreseen for 2026 following essentially flat quarterly growth for the remainder of 2025. All in all, it was felt that robust labour markets and rising real wages provided reasonable grounds for optimism regarding the e pected pick-up in growth. Private sector balance sheets were seen to be in good shape, and part of the increase in activity foreseen for 2026 and 2027 was driven by expectations of increased government investment in infrastructure and defence. Moreover, the e pected recovery in consumption was made more likely by the fact that the projections foresaw only a relatively gradual decline in the household saving rate, which was e pected to remain relatively high compared with the pre-pandemic period. At the same time, it was noted that the decline in the household saving rate factored into the projections might not materialise in the current environment of elevated trade policy uncertainty. Similarly, scepticism was e pressed regarding the projected rebound in housing investment, given that mortgage rates could be e pected to increase in line with higher long-term interest rates. More generally, caution was e pressed about the composition of the e pected pick-up in activity. In recent years higher public e penditure had to some e tent masked weakness in private sector activity. Looking ahead, given the economic and political constraints, public investment could turn out to be lower or less powerful in boosting economic growth than assumed in the baseline, even when abstracting from the lack of sufficient “fiscal space” in a number of jurisdictions. Labour markets continued to represent a bright spot for the euro area economy and contributed to its resilience in the current environment. Employment continued to grow, and April data indicated that the unemployment rate, at 6.2%, was at its lowest level since the launch of the euro. The positive signals from labour markets and growth in real wages, together with more favourable financing conditions, gave grounds for confidence that the euro area economy could weather the current trade policy storm and resume a growth path once conditions became more stable. However, attention was also drawn to some indications of a gradual softening in labour demand. This was evident, in particular, in the decline in job vacancy rates. In addition, while the manufacturing employment PMI indicated less negative developments, the services sector indicator had declined in April and May. Lastly, consumer surveys suggested that workers’ expectations for the unemployment rate had deteriorated and unemployed workers’ expectations of finding a job had fallen. With regard to fiscal and structural policies, it was argued that the boost to spending on infrastructure and defence, thus far seen as mainly concentrated in the largest euro area economy, would broadly offset the impact on activity from ongoing trade tensions. However, the time profile of the effects was seen to differ between the two shocks. Against this background, members considered that the risks to economic growth remained tilted to the downside. The main downside risks included a possible further escalation in global trade tensions and associated uncertainties, which could lower euro area growth by dampening e ports and dragging down investment and consumption. Furthermore, it was noted that a deterioration in financial market sentiment could lead to tighter financing conditions and greater risk aversion, and make firms and households less willing to invest and consume. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, remained a major source of uncertainty. On the other hand, it was noted that if trade and geopolitical tensions were resolved swiftly, this could lift sentiment and spur activity. A further increase in defence and infrastructure spending, together with productivity-enhancing reforms, would also add to growth. In the conte t of structural and fiscal policies, it was felt that while the current geopolitical situation posed challenges to the euro area economy, it also offered opportunities. However, these opportunities would only be realised if quick and decisive actions were taken by economic policymakers. It was noted that monetary policy had delivered, bringing inflation back to target despite the unprecedented shocks and challenges. It was observed that now was the time for other actors (in particular the European Commission and national governments) to step up quickly, particularly as the window of opportunity was likely to be limited. This included implementing the recommendations in the reports by Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta, and projects under the European savings and investment union. These measures would not only bring benefits in their own right, but could also strengthen the international role of the euro and enhance the resilience of the euro area economy more broadly. It was widely underlined that the present geopolitical environment made it even more urgent for fiscal and structural policies to make the euro area economy more productive, competitive and resilient. In particular, it was considered that the European Commission’s Competitiveness Compass provided a concrete roadmap for action, and its proposals, including on simplification, should be swiftly adopted. This included completing the savings and investment union, following a clear and ambitious timetable. It was also important to rapidly establish the legislative framework to prepare the ground for the potential introduction of a digital euro. Governments should ensure sustainable public finances in line with the EU’s economic governance framework, while prioritising essential growth-enhancing structural reforms and strategic investment. With regard to price developments, members largely concurred with the assessment presented by Mr Lane. The fact that the latest release showed that headline inflation – at 1.9% in May – was back in line with the target was widely welcomed. This flash estimate (released on Tuesday, 3 June, well after the cut-off point for the June projections) showed a noticeable decline in services inflation, to 3.2% in May from 4.0% in April. The drop was reassuring, as it supported the argument that the timing of Easter and its effect on travel-related (air transport and package holiday) prices had been behind the 0.5 percentage point uptick in services inflation in April. The rate of increase in non-energy industrial goods prices had remained contained at 0.6% in May. Accordingly, core inflation had decreased to 2.3%, from 2.7% in April, more than offsetting the 0.3 percentage point increase observed in that month. Some concern was e pressed about the increase in food price inflation to 3.3% in May, from 3.0% in April, but it was also noted that international food commodity prices had decreased most recently. It was widely acknowledged that consumer energy prices, which had declined by 3.6% year on year in May, were continuing to pull down the headline rate of inflation and were the key drivers of the downward revision of the inflation profile in the June projections compared with the March projections. Looking ahead, according to the June projections headline inflation was set to average 2.0% in 2025, 1.6% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027. It was underlined that the downward revisions compared with the March projections, by 0.3 percentage points for both 2025 and 2026, mainly reflected lower assumptions for energy prices and a stronger euro. The projections for core inflation, which was e pected to average 2.4% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026 and 2027, were broadly unchanged from the March projections. While energy prices and e change rates were likely to lead to headline inflation undershooting the target for some time, inflation dynamics would over the medium term increasingly be driven by the effects of fiscal policy. Hence headline inflation was on target for 2027, though this was partly due to a sizeable contribution from the implementation of ETS2. Overall, it was considered that the euro area was currently in a good place as far as inflation was concerned. There was increasing confidence that most measures of underlying inflation were consistent with inflation settling at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis, even as domestic inflation remained high. While wage growth remained elevated, there was broad agreement that wages were set to moderate visibly. Furthermore, profits were assessed to be partially buffering the impact of wage growth on inflation. However, it was also remarked that firms’ profit margins had been squeezed for some time, which increased the likelihood of cost-push shocks being passed through to prices. While short-term consumer inflation expectations had edged up in April, this likely reflected the impact of news about trade tensions. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continued to stand at around 2%. Regarding wage developments, it was noted that both hard data and survey data suggested that moderation was ongoing. This was supported particularly by incoming data on negotiated wages and available country data on compensation per employee. Furthermore, the ECB wage tracker pointed to a further easing of negotiated wage growth in 2025, while the staff projections saw wage growth falling below 3% in 2026 and 2027. It was noted that the projections for the rate of increase in compensation per employee – 2.8% in both 2026 and 2027 – would see wages rising just at the rate of inflation, 2.0%, plus trend productivity growth of 0.8%. It was commented, however, that compensation per employee in the first quarter of 2025 had surprised on the upside and that the decline in negotiated wage indicators was partly driven by one-off payments. Turning to the Governing Council’s risk assessment, it was considered that the outlook for euro area inflation was more uncertain than usual, as a result of the volatile global trade policy environment. Falling energy prices and a stronger euro could put further downward pressure on inflation. This could be reinforced if higher tariffs led to lower demand for euro area e ports and to countries with overcapacity rerouting their e ports to the euro area. Trade tensions could lead to greater volatility and risk aversion in financial markets, which would weigh on domestic demand and would thereby also lower inflation. By contrast, a fragmentation of global supply chains could raise inflation by pushing up import prices and adding to capacity constraints in the domestic economy. A boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation over the medium term. E treme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than e pected. Regarding the trade scenarios, a key issue in the risk assessment for inflation was the relative roles of demand-side and supply-side effects. It was broadly felt that the potential demand-side effects of tariffs were relatively well understood in the conte t of standard models, where they were typically treated as equivalent to a ta on cross-border goods and services. At the same time, uncertainties remained about the magnitude of these demand factors, with milder or more severe effects relative to the baseline both judged as being plausible. It was also argued that growth and sentiment had remained resilient despite e traordinarily high uncertainty. This suggested that the persistence of uncertainty, or its effects on growth and inflation, in the severe scenario might be overstated, especially given the current positive confidence effect in the euro area visible in financial markets. The relatively small impact on inflation even in the severe scenario, which pushed GDP growth to 0% in 2026, suggested that the downside risks to inflation were limited. Furthermore, it was noted that, while the trade policy scenarios and sensitivity analyses resulted in some variation in numbers depending on tariff assumptions, the effects were dwarfed by the impact of the assumptions for energy prices and the e change rate, which were common to all scenarios. In this conte t, it was suggested that the impact of the e change rate on inflation might be more muted than projected. First, the high level of the use of the euro as an invoicing currency limited the impact of the e change rate on inflation. Second, the pass-through from e change rate changes to inflation might be asymmetric, i.e. weaker in the case of an appreciation as firms sought to boost their compressed profit margins. Moreover, the analysis might be unable to properly capture the positive impact of higher confidence in the euro area, of which the stronger euro e change rate was just one reflection. The positive effects had also been visible in sovereign bond markets, with lower spreads and reduced term premia bringing down financing costs for sovereigns and firms. On potential supply-side effects, the e periences in the aftermath of the pandemic and Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine were mentioned as pointing to risks of strong adverse supply-side effects, which could be non-linear and appear quickly. In this conte t, it was noted that supply-side indicators, particularly concerning supply chains and potential bottlenecks, were being monitored and tracked very closely by staff. However, sufficient evidence had not so far been collected to substantiate these factors playing a major role. Moreover, attention was also drawn to potential disinflationary supply-side effects, for e ample arising from trade diversion from China. However, it was suggested that this effect was quantitatively limited. Moreover, it was argued that any large-scale trade diversion could prompt countermeasures from the EU, as was already the case in specific instances, which should attenuate disinflationary pressures. There was some discussion of whether energy commodity prices were weak because of demand or supply effects. It was noted that this had implications for the inflation risk assessment. If the weakness was primarily due to demand effects, then inflation risks were tied to the risks to economic activity and going in the same direction. If the weakness was due to supply effects, as suggested by staff analysis, in particular to oil production increases, then risks from energy prices could go in the opposite direction. Thus if the changes to oil production were reversed, energy prices could surprise on the upside even if economic activity surprised on the downside. Turning to the monetary and financial analysis, risk-free interest rates had remained broadly unchanged since the Governing Council’s previous monetary policy meeting on 16-17 April. Market participants were fully pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut at the current meeting. Broader financial conditions had eased in the euro area since the April meeting, with equity prices fully recovering their previous losses over the past month, corporate bond spreads narrowing and sovereign bond spreads declining to levels not seen for a long time. This was in response to more positive news about global trade policies, an improvement in global risk sentiment and higher confidence in the euro area. At the same time, it was highlighted that there had still been significant negative news about global trade policies over recent weeks. In this conte t, it was argued that market participants might have become slightly over-optimistic, as they had become more accustomed both to negative news and to policy reversals from the United States, and this could pose risks. It was seen as noteworthy that overall financial conditions had continued to ease recently without markets e pecting a substantial further reduction in policy rates. It was also contended that the fiscal package in the euro area’s largest economy might push up the neutral rate of interest, suggesting that the recent loosening of financial conditions was even more significant when assessed against this rate benchmark. The euro had stayed close to the level it had reached following the announcement of the German fiscal package in March and the deepening trade and financial tensions in April. In this conte t, structural factors could be influencing e change rates, possibly including greater confidence in the euro area and an adverse outlook for US fiscal policies. These developments could e plain US dollar weakness despite the recent increase in long-term government bond yields in the United States and their decline in the euro area. Portfolio managers had also started to rebalance away from the US dollar and US assets. If this were to continue, the euro might e perience further appreciation pressures. In addition, there had recently been a significant increase in the issuance of “reverse Yankee” bonds – euro-denominated bonds issued by companies based outside the euro area and in particular in the United States – partly reflecting wider yield differentials. In the euro area, the transmission of past interest rate cuts continued to make corporate borrowing less e pensive overall, and interest rates on deposits were also still declining. At the same time, lending rates were flattening out. The average interest rate on new loans to firms had declined to 3.8% in April, from 3.9% in March, while the cost of issuing market-based debt had been unchanged at 3.7%. The average interest rate on new mortgages had stayed at 3.3% in April but was e pected to increase in the near future owing to higher long-term yields since the cut-off date for the March projections. Bank lending to firms had continued to strengthen gradually, growing by an annual rate of 2.6% in April after 2.4% in March, while corporate bond issuance had been subdued. The growth in mortgage lending had increased to 1.9%. The sustained recovery in credit was welcome, with the annual growth in credit to both firms and households now at its highest level since June 2023. It was remarked that credit growth had seemingly become resilient even though the recovery had started from, on average, higher interest rates than in previous cycles. Households’ demand for mortgages had continued to increase swiftly according to the bank lending survey. This seemed to be a natural consequence of interest rates on housing loans being already below their historical average, with mortgage demand much more sensitive to interest rates than corporate loan demand. With interest rates on corporate loans still declining, although remaining above their historical average, the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises had also shown that firms did not see access to finance as an obstacle to borrowing, as loan applications had increased and many companies not applying for loans appeared to have sufficient internal funds. At the same time, loan demand was picking up from still subdued levels and credit growth remained fairly muted by historical standards. Furthermore, elevated uncertainty due to trade tensions and geopolitical risks was still not fully reflected in the available hard data. It was also observed that by reducing e ternal competitiveness, the recent appreciation of the euro could affect e porters’ credit demand. In their biannual e change on the links between monetary policy and financial stability, members concurred that while euro area banks had remained resilient, broader financial stability risks remained elevated, in particular owing to highly uncertain and volatile global trade policies. Risks in global sovereign bond markets were also discussed, and it was noted that the euro area sovereign bond market was proving more resilient than had been the case for a long time. Macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, enhancing resilience and preserving macroprudential space. Monetary policy stance and policy considerations Turning to the monetary policy stance, members assessed the data that had become available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements that the Governing Council had communicated in 2023 as shaping its reaction function. These comprised (i) the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook, (ii) the dynamics of underlying inflation, and (iii) the strength of monetary policy transmission. Starting with the inflation outlook, members welcomed the fact that headline inflation was currently at around the 2% medium-term target, and that this had occurred earlier than previously anticipated as a result of lower energy prices and a stronger e change rate. Lower energy prices and a stronger euro would continue to put downward pressure on inflation in the near term, with inflation projected to fall below the target in 2026 before returning to target in 2027. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continued to stand at around 2%, which also supported the stabilisation of inflation around the target. Members discussed the e tent to which the projected temporary undershooting of the inflation target was a concern. Concerns were e pressed that following the downward revisions to annual inflation for both 2025 and 2026, inflation was projected to be below the target for 18 months, which could be considered as e tending into the medium term. It was argued that 2026 would be an important year because below-target inflation expectations could become embedded in wage negotiations and lead to downside second-round effects. It was also contended that the risk of undershooting the target for a prolonged period was due not only to energy prices and the e change rate but also to weak demand and the e pected slowdown in wage growth. In addition, the timing and effects of fiscal e pansion remained uncertain. It was important to keep in mind that the inflation undershoot remaining temporary was conditional on an appropriate setting of monetary policy. At the same time, it was highlighted that, despite the undershooting of the target in the relatively near term, which was partly due to sizeable energy base effects amplified by the appreciation of the euro, from a medium-term perspective inflation was set to remain broadly at around 2%. In view of this, it was important not to overemphasise the downside deviation, especially since it was mainly due to volatile e ternal factors, which could easily reverse. Therefore, the risk of a sustained undershooting of the inflation target was seen as limited unless there was a sharp deterioration in labour market conditions. The return of inflation to target would be supported by the likely emergence of upside pressures on inflation, especially from fiscal policy. So, as long as the projected undershoot did not become more pronounced or affect the return to target in 2027, and provided that inflation expectations remained anchored, the soft inflation figures foreseen in the near term should be manageable. Turning to underlying inflation, members concurred that most measures suggested that inflation would settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. While core inflation remained elevated, it was projected to decline to 1.9% in 2026 and remain there in 2027. This was seen as consistent with the stabilisation of inflation at target. Some other measures of underlying inflation, including domestic inflation, were still elevated but were also moving in the right direction. The projected decline in underlying inflation was e pected to be supported by further deceleration in wage growth and a reduction in services inflation. Although the pace of wage growth was still strong, it had continued to moderate visibly, as indicated by incoming data on negotiated wages and available country data on compensation per employee, and profits were also partially buffering its impact on inflation. Looking ahead, underlying inflation could come under further downward pressure if the projected near-term undershooting of headline inflation lowered wage expectations, and also because large shocks to energy prices typically percolated across the economy. At the same time, fiscal policy and tariffs had the potential to generate new upward pressure on underlying inflation over the medium term. Finally, transmission of monetary policy continued to be smooth. Looking back over a long period, it was observed that robust and data-driven monetary policy had made a significant contribution to bringing inflation back to the 2% target. The removal of monetary restriction over the past year had also been timely in helping to ensure that inflation would stabilise sustainably at around the target in the period ahead. Its transmission to lending rates had been effective, contributing to easier financing conditions and supporting credit growth. Some of the transmission from rate cuts remained in the pipeline and would continue to provide support to the economy, helping consumers and firms withstand the fallout from the volatile global environment. Concerns that increased uncertainty and a volatile market response to the trade tensions in April would have a tightening impact on financing conditions had eased. On the contrary, financial frictions appeared low in the euro area, with limited risk premia and declining term premia supporting transmission of the monetary impulse and bringing down financing costs for sovereign and corporate borrowers. At the same time, elevated uncertainty could weaken the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, possibly because of the option value of deferring consumption and investment decisions in such an environment. There also remained a risk that a deterioration in financial market sentiment could lead to tighter financing conditions and greater risk aversion, and make firms and households less willing to invest and consume. It was contended that, after seven rate cuts, interest rates were now firmly in neutral territory and possibly already in accommodative territory. It was argued that this was also suggested by the upturn in credit growth and by the bank lending survey. However, it was highlighted that, although banks were lending more and demand for loans was rising, credit origination remained at subdued levels when compared with a range of benchmarks based on past regularities. Investment also remained weak compared with historical benchmarks. Monetary policy decisions and communication Against this background, almost all members supported the proposal made by Mr Lane to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Lowering the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steered the monetary policy stance – was justified by its updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. A further reduction in interest rates was seen as warranted to protect the medium-term inflation target beyond 2026, in an environment in which inflation was currently at target but projected to fall below it for a temporary period. In this conte t, it was recalled that the staff projections were conditioned on a market curve that embedded a 25 basis point rate cut in June and about 50 basis points of cuts in total by the end of 2025. It was also noted that the staff scenarios and sensitivity analyses generally pointed to inflation being below the target in 2026. Moreover, while inflation was consistent with the target, the growth projection for 2026 had been revised slightly downwards. The proposed reduction in policy rates should be seen as aiming to protect the “on target” 2% projection for 2027. It should ensure that the temporary undershoot in headline inflation did not become prolonged, in a conte t in which further disinflation in core measures was e pected, the growth outlook remained relatively weak and spare capacity in manufacturing made it unlikely that slightly faster growth would translate into immediate inflationary pressures. It was argued that cutting interest rates by 25 basis points at the current meeting would leave rates in broadly neutral territory. This would keep the Governing Council well positioned to navigate the high uncertainty that lay ahead, while affording full optionality for future meetings to manage two-sided inflation risks across a wide range of scenarios. By contrast, keeping interest rates at their current levels could increase the risk of undershooting the inflation target in 2026 and 2027. At the same time, a few members saw a case for keeping interest rates at their current levels. The near-term temporary inflation undershoot should be looked through, since it was mostly due to volatile factors such as lower energy prices and a stronger e change rate, which could easily reverse. It remained to be seen whether and to what e tent these factors would translate into lower core inflation. It was necessary to avoid reacting e cessively to volatility in headline inflation at a time when domestic inflation remained high and there might be new upward pressure on underlying inflation over the medium term – from both tariffs and fiscal policy. This was especially the case after a period of above-target inflation and when the inflation expectations of firms and households were still above target, with short-term consumer inflation expectations having increased recently and inflation expectations standing above 2% across horizons. This implied that there was a very limited risk of a downward unanchoring of inflation expectations. There were also several reasons why the projections and scenarios might be underestimating medium-term inflationary pressures. There could be upside risks from underlying inflation, in part because services inflation remained above levels compatible with a sustained return to the inflation target. The e ceptional uncertainty relating to trade tensions had reduced confidence in the baseline projections and meant that there could be value in waiting to see how the trade war unfolded. In addition, although growth was only picking up gradually and there were risks to the downside, the probability of a recession was currently quite low and interest rates were already low enough not to hold back economic growth. The point was made that the labour market had proven very resilient, with the unemployment rate at a historical low and employment e panding despite prospects of higher tariffs. Given the recent re-flattening of the Phillips curve, the risk of a sustained undershooting of the inflation target was seen as limited in the absence of a sharp deterioration of labour market conditions. It was also argued that adopting an accommodative monetary policy stance would not be appropriate. In any case, the evidence suggested that such accommodation would not be very effective in an environment of high uncertainty. In this conte t, it was also contended that interest rates could already be in accommodative territory. An argument was made that the neutral rate of interest had undergone a shift since early 2022, increasing substantially, and it was still likely to increase further owing to fiscal e pansion and the shift from a dearth of safe assets to a government bond glut. However, it was pointed out that while e pected policy rates and the term premium had increased in 2022, there was an open question as to the e tent to which that reflected an increase in the neutral rate of interest or simply the removal of e traordinary policy accommodation. It was argued that the recent weakness in investment, strength of savings and still subdued credit volumes suggested that there probably had not been a significant increase in the neutral rate of interest. With these considerations in mind, these members e pressed an initial preference for keeping interest rates unchanged to allow more time to analyse the current situation and detect any sustained inflationary or disinflationary pressures. However, in light of the preceding discussion, they ultimately e pressed readiness to join the consensus, with the e ception of one member, who upheld a dissenting view. Looking ahead, members reiterated that the Governing Council remained determined to ensure that inflation would stabilise sustainably at its 2% medium-term target. The Governing Council’s interest rate decisions would continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. E ceptional uncertainty also underscored the importance of following a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. Given the pervasive uncertainty, the possibility of rapid changes in the economic environment and the risk of shocks to inflation in both directions, it was important for the Governing Council to retain a two-sided perspective and avoid tying its hands ahead of any future meeting. The nature and focus of data dependence might need to evolve to place more emphasis on indicators speaking to future developments. This possibly suggested placing a greater premium on e amining high-frequency data, financial market data, survey data and soft information such as from corporate contacts, for e ample, to help gauge any supply chain problems. It was also underlined that scenarios would continue to be important in helping to assess and convey uncertainty. Against this background, it was maintained that the rate path needed to remain consistent with meeting the target over the medium term and that agility would be vital given the elevated uncertainty. At the same time, the view was e pressed that monetary policy should become less reactive to incoming data. In particular, only large shocks would imply the need for a monetary policy response, as the Governing Council should be willing to tolerate moderate deviations from target as long as inflation expectations were anchored. Turning to communication, members concurred that, in view of the latest inflation developments and projections, it was time to refer to inflation as being “currently at around the Governing Council’s 2% medium-term target” rather than saying that the disinflation process was “well on track”. It was also agreed that e ternal communication should make clear that the alternative scenarios to be published were prepared by staff, that they were illustrative in that they only represented a subset of alternative possibilities, that they only assessed some of the mechanisms by which different trade policies could affect growth and inflation, and that their outcomes were conditional on the assumptions used. Taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members, upon a proposal by the President, the Governing Council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release. The members of the Governing Council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement, which the President and the Vice-President would, as usual, deliver at the press conference following the Governing Council meeting.

Inflation In May, the median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months remained unchanged at 3.1% for the fourth consecutive month. This was its lowest level since September 2021. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 2.8%. E pectations for three years ahead also decreased, by 0.1 percentage points, to 2.4% while expectations for inflation five years ahead were unchanged at 2.1% for the si th consecutive month. Uncertainty about inflation expectations over the next 12 months decreased in May, reversing the increase observed in April. While the broad evolution of inflation perceptions and expectations remained relatively closely aligned across income groups, over the previous year and a half inflation perceptions and short-horizon expectations for lower income quintiles were, on average, slightly above those for higher income quintiles. Younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 35-54 and 55-70), albeit to a lesser degree than in previous years. Inflation results Income and consumption Consumers’ nominal income growth expectations over the next 12 months increased to 1.0%, from 0.9% in April. This increase was observed across all income groups. Perceived nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months increased to 5.0%, from 4.9% in April. Conversely, e pected nominal spending growth over the next 12 months decreased to 3.5% in May, from 3.7% in April. This decrease was prevalent across all income quintiles, e cept for the lowest income group. Income and consumption results Economic growth and labour market Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months became less negative, standing at -1.1% in May compared with -1.9% in April. E pectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead decreased to 10.4%, from 10.5% in April. Consumers continued to e pect the future unemployment rate to be only slightly higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (9.9%), implying a broadly stable labour market. Economic growth and labour market results Housing and credit access Consumers e pected the price of their home to increase by 3.2% over the next 12 months, which was unchanged from April. Households in the lowest income quintile continued to e pect higher growth in house prices compared with those in the highest income quintile (3.5% and 3.1% respectively). E pectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead declined to 4.4%, from 4.5% in April. As in previous months, the lowest income households e pected the highest mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead (4.9%), while the highest income households e pected the lowest rates (4.1%). The net percentage of households reporting a tightening (relative to those reporting an easing) in access to credit over the previous 12 months declined. The net percentage of those e pecting a tightening over the next 12 months declined as well, reversing the increase seen in April. Housing and credit access results The release of the Consumer E pectations Survey (CES) results for June is scheduled for 29 July 2025.",

The initiative follows a two-track approach: the first track “Pontes” provides a short-term offering to the market – including a pilot phase – and the second track “Appia” focuses on a potential long-term solution. The decision is in line with the Eurosystem’s commitment to supporting innovation without compromising on safety and efficiency in financial market infrastructures. Pontes will offer a Eurosystem DLT-based solution, linking DLT platforms and TARGET Services to settle transactions in central bank money. The Eurosystem plans to launch a pilot for Pontes by the end of the third quarter of 2026. It will offer a single Eurosystem solution which incorporates features used in the Eurosystem's e ploratory work on DLT in 2024 . During the pilot, the Eurosystem will also explore the feasibility of further enhancements in line with the TARGET Services operational, legal and technical standards. Between now and the launch of the Pontes pilot, the Eurosystem will consider requests for further DLT-related trials and e periments. Appia focuses on a long-term approach for an innovative and integrated ecosystem in Europe that also facilitates safe and efficient operations at the global level. The Eurosystem will actively continue to analyse DLT-based solutions and collaborate with public and private stakeholders. To ensure continuous dialogue with the market, the Eurosystem will establish dedicated market contact groups for both Pontes and Appia. A call for e pressions of interest in participating in the Pontes contact group will be published soon. Pontes and Appia will build on the Eurosystem’s e ploratory work on new technologies for wholesale central bank money settlement, which was conducted between May and November 2024. In this e ploratory work, 64 participants conducted over 50 trials and e periments. A dedicated report outlining the results of the e ploratory work has been published today.",

      "content": "SPEECH Strategy assessment: lessons learned Introductory speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the opening reception of the ECB Forum on Central Banking 2025 \"Adapting to change: macroeconomic shifts and policy responses\" Sintra, 30 June 2025 As Nietzsche once observed, “it is our future that lays down the law of our today.” When we last reviewed our strategy four years ago, our thinking was shaped – quite naturally – by the recent past: a decade of too-low inflation, compounded by the pandemic. But as Nietzsche warned, there is a danger in letting the past dominate our thinking. Sometimes, it is the future – still dimly understood – that is already shaping our present. And soon after that review, the world changed in ways we had not foreseen. The reopening of our economies after the pandemic brought about major sectoral shifts. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered a fundamental shift in energy markets. The geopolitical landscape was upended, reshaping global trade. And structural changes in labour markets became increasingly apparent – driven by demographics, technological transformation, and evolving worker preferences. Given all these developments, the fundamentals of our strategy have held up well – as they should, because a sound strategy must be robust to a changing environment. Our symmetric 2% inflation target has proven effective in anchoring expectations – even through some of the most severe and persistent shocks in recent economic history. And our medium-term orientation has provided essential fle ibility to absorb an e tremely large shock – helping to reduce the overall cost of disinflation to the economy, while still enabling a timely return of inflation to target. We therefore saw no need to revisit these core pillars – which is why we refer to the e ercise we have just concluded as a strategy assessment rather than a review. The central theme of our work has been to update the framework so that monetary policy can continue to deliver price stability in the face of the new types of shocks we are confronting. This evening, without downplaying the other lessons learned, I would like to highlight three key conclusions that have emerged from this work. They concern the nature of the new environment, how we assess the risks that arise from it, and how we have adjusted our reaction function to safeguard price stability in this new world. The changing environment One word has dominated the public debate in recent weeks: uncertainty. And this is one of the first key conclusions from our strategy assessment: the world ahead is more uncertain – and that uncertainty is likely to make inflation more volatile. First, we see clear signs that supply shocks are becoming more frequent. Model-based analysis by ECB staff shows that, during the recent inflation surge, such shocks played a much greater role in driving inflation than they had over the previous two decades. And even today, supply-side forces continue to generate inflation risks in both directions. Second, we see mounting evidence that more regular supply disruptions are leading firms to adjust prices more frequently – thereby contributing to greater inflation volatility. This is not simply an e trapolation from the most recent shock. Rather, it reflects a structural shift in how firms operate under conditions of permanently higher uncertainty. Research shows that, in such an environment, firms tend to react more quickly to shocks – especially supply ones – in order to protect against potential future losses. [ 1 ] At the same time, they are more likely to adopt more fle ible pricing strategies, which means prices may respond not just to major shocks, but also to smaller frictions and local disruptions. [ 2 ] Third, if inflation becomes more volatile, we could see non-linearities on both sides. In our last strategy review, we rightly focused on the non-linear dynamics that emerge in a prolonged environment of too-low inflation – where interest rates are eventually pushed to their effective lower bound. That constraint can, in turn, feed into inflation expectations and risk creating a self-fulfilling low-inflation trap. And we remain alert to the possibility of renewed downside inflation shocks. But recent e perience has also revealed non-linearities on the upside. Since firms are generally quicker to raise prices than to lower them, more frequent price adjustments mean inflation can rise quickly in response to large upside shocks. If wages then adjust only gradually to these price increases – as we saw in recent years – inflation may remain above target for longer as wage growth slowly catches up. This, in turn, can raise the risk of inflation expectations de-anchoring on the upside. [ 3 ] Assessing the distribution of risks The next question that follows is: if the economic environment becomes more volatile, how can we make our economic assessment more robust? Large shocks can trigger feedback loops and non-linear effects that inherently give rise to a broader range of possible outcomes. In a world of higher uncertainty, it is all the more important to augment the baseline with alternative risk scenarios. This is why the second key conclusion of our assessment is the need for monetary policy to take into account risks and uncertainty, using a systematic but conte t-specific approach. The ECB has used both scenario and sensitivity analysis for many years – deploying internal scenarios since the global financial crisis and publishing them for the first time during the pandemic. But our e perience in recent years has underscored the particular strength of scenario analysis in times of elevated uncertainty. A clear e ample is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting energy price shock. In that case, scenarios provided insights that neither our baseline projections nor standard sensitivity analyses around the baseline could fully capture. For instance, in March 2022 – just a few weeks after the invasion – our baseline projected inflation at around 5% for that year, based on market-implied energy futures. The sensitivity analysis suggested a slightly higher figure of about 5.5%. In contrast, the Ukraine war scenario already pointed to inflation e ceeding 7% – close to the final annual figure of over 8%. At the same time, there were moments when – in hindsight – publishing scenarios could have supported both our policymaking and our communication. One e ample was the high uncertainty in 2021 about the speed of vaccine rollout and the nature of post-pandemic reopening, including the sectoral shifts in supply and demand across goods and services sectors, both in the euro area and globally. [ 4 ] Scenario analysis could have helped in illustrating that the range of possible inflation outcomes was unusually wide – and reduced the risk of projecting false certainty to the public. This is why our updated strategy commits to ensuring that our policy decisions account not only for the most likely path of inflation and the economy, but also for the surrounding risks and uncertainty – including through the appropriate use of scenario and sensitivity analyses. The reaction function So what should our reaction function be, if we know that the road ahead is likely to be more uncertain? In our last strategy review, we e plicitly acknowledged the risks posed by the effective lower bound. Our strategy statement called for “especially forceful or persistent” action when policy rates are close to the lower bound. This “asymmetric” focus was grounded in the asymmetry of policy space and the downward inflation bias it can produce. The lower bound continues to constrain monetary policy in the face of large disinflationary shocks. But the recent inflation surge has revealed upside non-linearities – and with them, the need for a two-sided reaction function, both in terms of forcefulness or persistence. This is the third key conclusion of our strategy assessment. This is not about reacting to small or temporary deviations, but about a symmetric commitment to respond to inflation dynamics that could de-anchor inflation expectations in either direction. When disinflationary shocks risk pushing policy rates towards the lower bound, acting forcefully early on helps minimise the time spent near that constraint. Likewise, when inflation overshoots raise the risk of a feedback loop between frequent price adjustments and staggered wage responses, forceful tightening at the outset is key to anchoring expectations. We began our recent policy cycle with historically large rate hikes delivered at an unprecedented pace. Our analysis shows that, had we not acted, the probability of inflation expectations de-anchoring would have e ceeded 30% in 2022 and 2023. [ 5 ] At the same time, this policy cycle also offered new perspectives on optimal policy paths. One insight from our last strategy review was that, when rates are near the lower bound, persistence can substitute for forcefulness – helping to deliver the necessary policy stance with fewer side effects. Until recently, however, this concept had not been widely applied to tightening cycles. Typically, forceful tightening follows an inverted V-shape – with rapid rate increases followed by relatively swift cuts. But as rates move deeper into restrictive territory, the costs and side effects of further tightening also grow. At that point, it can become optimal to shift the focus from forcefulness to persistence – even if, in principle, there is no upper bound constraining policy space. Model simulations support this insight: forcefulness and persistence can act as substitutes, both capable of delivering the necessary disinflation. But persistence, in particular, can help limit the economic and financial stability costs compared with continued rate increases. This was borne out in our own e perience. When we entered what I described as the “holding phase”, we placed greater weight on the persistence dimension. [ 6 ] This allowed the disinflation process to advance at a steady pace, while the so-called “sacrifice ratio” remained historically low compared with previous disinflation episodes. [ 7 ] Reflecting this e perience, the Governing Council considers that its reaction function is best described as requiring “appropriately forceful or persistent monetary policy action in response to large, sustained deviations of inflation from the target in either direction .” To this end, all our instruments remain available in our toolkit. But the word “appropriately” is important, as it underscores that the choice of instruments, and the intensity with which we use them, must reflect proportionality. Conclusion Let me conclude. Our strategy assessment has been an e ercise in evolution, not revolution – and in fact, many of its conclusions are already reflected in our current policy conduct. We responded to the recent inflation shock with initially forceful and then persistent action, aiming to steer inflation back to target as swiftly as necessary, but as painlessly as possible. And scenario analysis is helping us to better understand the range of risks ahead – and how best to respond to them. For e ample, our scenarios on potential US import tariffs have helped us navigate an uncertain global trade landscape, while also enabling us to communicate more clearly the two-sided risks shaping our current monetary policy stance. At our last monetary policy press conference in June, I described our monetary policy stance as being “in a good place”. Following the conclusion of this strategy assessment, I would add that our monetary policy strategy is also in a good place – strengthened by e perience, and better equipped for the challenges of the future. To close the circle with Nietzsche: “he who has a why to live can bear almost any how.” Even as the world changes around us, we know our purpose. And we will do whatever is necessary to deliver on it – ensuring price stability for the people of Europe. Kase, H. and Rigato, R.

      "content": "OPENING REMARKS PRESS CONFERENCE Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB Sintra, 30 June 2025 Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers Good afternoon, ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane and I welcome you to this press conference, on the occasion of the conclusion of the 2025 assessment of our monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council recently agreed on an updated monetary policy strategy statement. You can find this statement on our website, together with an e planatory overview note and the two occasional papers presenting the underlying analyses. I will start by putting this strategy assessment into the broader conte t. Philip Lane will then go through the updated strategy statement and e plain what has changed and why, as well as what has remained unchanged. Following the strategy review we carried out in 2020-21, the Governing Council committed to “assess periodically the appropriateness of its monetary policy strategy, with the next assessment e pected in 2025”. Such regular assessments ensure that our framework, toolkit and approach remain fit for purpose in a changing world. And the world has changed significantly over the last four years. Some of the issues we were most concerned about back in 2021 – including inflation being too low for too long – have taken a rather different turn. Not only did we see inflation surge, but some fundamental structural features of our economy and the inflation environment are changing: geopolitics, digitalisation, the increasing use of artificial intelligence, demographics, the threat to environmental sustainability and the evolution of the international financial system. All of those suggest that the environment in which we operate will remain highly uncertain and potentially more volatile. This will make it more challenging to conduct our monetary policy and fulfil our mandate to keep prices stable. During the strategy assessment, we asked: what do these changes mean for the way we assess the economy, conduct our policy, use our toolkit, take our decisions and communicate them? In seeking to answer this question, our mindset was forward-looking. On the whole, we concluded that our monetary policy strategy remains well suited to addressing the challenges that lie ahead. But our strategy also needs to be updated and adjusted in certain areas, so that the ECB can remain fit for purpose in the years to come. The next assessment is e pected in 2030. With our updated strategy statement, we are taking a comprehensive perspective on the challenges facing our monetary policy, so that the ECB can remain an anchor of stability in this more uncertain world. This is our core message to the euro area citizens we serve: the new environment gives many reasons to worry, but one thing they do not need to worry about is our commitment to price stability. The ECB is committed to its mandate and will keep itself and its tools updated to be able to respond to new challenges. Let me conclude by thanking, on behalf of the Governing Council, all the colleagues across the Eurosystem who have contributed to this assessment in a great team effort. I now hand over to our Chief Economist Philip Lane and, following his remarks, we will be ready to take your questions. * * * Philip R. Lane: I’m going to focus on the 12 paragraphs of The ECB’s monetary policy strategy statement . What’s important is that behind these paragraphs is a lot of work. The base layer is the two occasional papers. I’m sure you’ve already read the 400 pages in those two occasional papers. There’s a lot of rich new analysis of many dimensions in those two occasional papers. Then we have the overview note, which the Governing Council worked on collectively and which basically provides the elaboration behind these 12 paragraphs. And I would say that in these 12 paragraphs, in this review, we essentially tried to review the economic assessment: where are we and where are we likely to be? That was one of the two work streams. That essentially primarily shows up in paragraph 1. So paragraph 1, you might say, is one paragraph, but it’s a very important paragraph because it essentially outlines the challenges that we may face. We had a similar paragraph last time, but last time the focus was essentially on a lot of factors that can give rise to a low-inflation world and a low interest rate world. Whereas the assessment this time of the Eurosystem staff behind this is that when we look where we are now in the structural changes facing the world economy, we have geopolitics, and a lot of this is in the direction of rolling back globalisation. Last time we were looking at globalisation as a force which did contribute to low inflation before the pandemic. There are many dimensions to geopolitics, but we are of course already living it and this is something we do think is going to shape the next five years. We already mentioned digitalisation the last time, but this time we’re calling that as a separate and important element: artificial intelligence. Because, of course, I think for a long time it has been understood that the world economy automates and digitalises. That’s been around for a while. That’s mature. What’s not mature and where there’s really a wide range of possibilities is: what does it mean as the business sector and the public sector incorporate artificial intelligence? I think we had already called out demography and the threat to environmental sustainability, and I think we’re very correct to have done so five years ago. We’ve seen a lot on these fronts in these five years. Let me remind you: without immigration, the European labour force would be shrinking. So demography is not just a future trend, it’s a year-by-year reality for us. And then this week, last week, this year, last year, all the time we see the impact of weather shocks and the impact of the green transition. By the way, investment in Europe in recent years would have been a lot lower without the green transition. It’s the one solid driver of investment for many sectors at the moment. We call out all of these elements, but what’s critical for our conclusion for monetary policy is that it creates uncertainty, it creates volatility, and we think what we may be faced with is larger deviations from our 2% target in both directions. So we have this two-sided risk assessment. And as I go through these paragraphs, essentially once we’ve identified this economic assessment, the natural question to ask is: how do we manage it? How does monetary policy manage this two-sided risk? And essentially in what follows, we will turn to the monetary policy implications. But the other thing to note about paragraph 1 is that there is a new sentence. That’s the final sentence. It is that we don’t live in a bubble. We don’t say monetary policy is the only game in town. And we do highlight here that a more resilient financial architecture – supported by progress on the savings and investments union, the completion of banking union and the introduction of a digital euro – would also support the effectiveness of monetary policy in this evolving environment. So, in other words, all of these structural changes are much more easily handled if we have a more resilient euro, European and euro-denominated financial system. And I think that’s also important and maybe helps you to understand why we as Board members, and more generally the Governing Council, spend a lot of time talking about these wider issues. It’s not a distraction from monetary policy. It’s an important underpinning for monetary policy. Paragraph 2 is unchanged because paragraph 2 is setting the legal conte t. We have a mandate given by the Treaty, and so to make the strategy statement self-contained, it’s a reminder to you of the legal and Treaty constraints we live under. And that essentially remains the same as last time. The third paragraph, because remember in the European Treaty there’s not a super detailed definition of price stability, so it’s important and this is something that evolved over the years: that in terms of measurement, we’re focused on the Harmonised Inde of Consumer Prices (HICP). And again, this is stable from last time. Last time we highlighted that we did think a reform of the HICP to include owner-occupied housing would be desirable. We continue to hold that view. But in the end it’s for the European Statistical System to make progress on that. So what we say is that in the meantime we do take into account inflation measures that include estimates of the cost of owner-occupied housing. So, in other words, we create supplementary indicators. These are not official data, but we do take a look. And these would be relevant in scenarios where house prices were rising far more quickly or far more slowly than the overall inflation rate. By the way, this has not been particularly the issue in recent years. It would not have made a big difference in recent years, but of course in principle we could be in a situation in the future where it made a difference. Paragraph 4 is again largely stable from last time. It’s e plaining why we target 2%, not zero, and that’s a fairly mature topic: why you want to have a safety margin. We do, and I think correctly this time, in the final sentence of paragraph 4 include intersectoral adjustment. In the last five years we’ve seen this massive change between goods prices and services prices. And actually it turns out that that’s a very important consideration. It’s a lot easier to handle an under 2% inflation target than if you’re trying to hit zero. Essentially if you’re trying to hit zero and the price of energy compared with goods rose, implicitly you need to drive down the price of goods. And we know for many reasons that deflation, even at the sectoral level, is difficult. So having a 2% target is reinforced by including intersectoral adjustment in that list. So, paragraph 4 says you need a safety margin. Paragraph 5 says 2% is the best way to maintain price stability and that our commitment is symmetric. So what this symmetry means is that we consider negative and positive deviations from the target as equally undesirable. The last sentence, I think, has been critical in these years: having a clear target. You may have heard us all many times say 2%. It’s not somewhere in the region of 2%. It’s 2%. And having that clarity is very important for anchoring expectations, so I think it turned out that that choice we made to be precise about what our orientation is in the medium term is very important. Let me turn to a paragraph where I think there has been an important change, a sensible change – something that you might say sounds so sensible, why are you talking about it? But it’s worth highlighting the update. Last time, in 2021, we felt we needed to point out that the symmetry of the target doesn’t mean that how we set monetary policy looks identical whether we’re above the target or below the target. And so we pointed out that if we have a lower bound issue, we need to be appropriately forceful or persistent. What have we learnt from these five years? That remains true for below-target inflation, but actually it’s equally true for above-target inflation. And what we actually did was we had a phase of being forceful. So from July 2022 to September 2023, we hiked a lot. And then we went into a persistent phase. So from September 2023 to June 2024, we had 4%. The overview note goes into more detail about why you need the blend of forceful and persistent. But when we reviewed this, peers said these were important concepts in relation to the lower bound, but they’re equally appropriate concepts in relation to being above target. It’s not, of course, in relation to blips. What we talk about here is in response to large, sustained deviations. So you have to first of all make the call. What we see in front of us is something that’s materially away from 2% and that would remain away from 2% unless we responded. And this is why we say “appropriately forceful or persistent”, because what e actly is appropriate depends on whether you are dealing with an upside shock, a downside shock and a wider set of issues. So that, I think, is important. Let me come back to this issue that we have a symmetric commitment and we’re two-sided, but the headache is different on both sides. On the downside, the lower bound is the main headache. On the upside – and this reflects so much of the last number of years and reflects a lot of the work in the occasional papers – is possible non-linearities in price and wage-setting. What we learnt is that once inflation starts to build, it can take off and it can accelerate. You can get this non-linear dynamic. And that’s why you need to be forceful on the upside. That’s not really true for downside shocks. They tend not to accelerate, but downside shocks tend to get embedded because your ability to respond on monetary policy is different. Going back to this point that it’s not about smoothing out every deviation from 2% and it’s large, sustained deviations: this is very much in the spirit of the medium-term orientation. And that’s paragraph 7. So paragraph 7 is stable. We already had a medium-term orientation, I think, throughout the whole history of the ECB. And I think that’s been very wise. Our commitment, in line with the opening remarks from the President, is that people should be able to count on our commitment to price stability. If we see a deviation, we will bring it back to 2%. And that’s our medium-term orientation. There’s one enrichment here, which I think makes sense. People often ask: how long is the medium term? And I think a very important discipline on that is in the final sentence now: “subject to maintaining anchored inflation expectations”. That really defines the medium term. As you know, in recent years we mapped that into “we will make sure inflation returns to target in a timely manner”. You need to impose some discipline on yourself as opposed to saying the medium term is always just over the projection horizon. The medium term means not so long that the anchoring of expectations is put at risk. So again, I think that’s always been true, but it’s better to be e plicit about it. And maybe now, as journalists, if you ask Governing Council members in the future how long the medium term is, the medium term is how long it takes without putting into question the anchoring of expectations. Paragraph 8 is our toolbo paragraph. We already said in 2021 that our primary instrument is the set of ECB policy rates. I do wonder, for those of you who were involved in looking at the ECB in 2021, how many of you fully believed that as we moved away from the lower bound, we would stop quantitative easing (QE) and we would stop forward guidance? But that was in our strategy and that’s what we did. These are tools that make sense at the lower bound. They are not tools from a stance point of view that have the same role away from the lower bound. So one basic message is: already in 2021 we told you a lot about how the toolbo works, but we did obviously come back and look at this. It’s an important topic. Let me highlight a couple of revisions here, or amplifications. One is that I think we are more articulate now about when these tools come into play. One is to steer the monetary policy stance when the rates are close to the lower bound. That’s what we said last time. That’s definitely a big category. But the second category is “or to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission”. March 2020 is one e ample. When the world’s financial market was hit by the pandemic shock, central banks in general did a lot of asset purchasing, refinancing operations and other elements to stabilise the transmission of monetary policy. So again, what I would say is either it’s because we’re near the lower bound or there’s some big drama causing an interruption to the transmission of monetary policy. But otherwise these instruments remain in the toolbo . They’re available, but they’re not used on a continuous basis. And so we list out these tools just as a reminder. Longer-term refinancing and asset purchases: those two would possibly be used either way. For the stance or for smoothing the transmission of policy. Whereas of course negative rates and forward guidance are more particular to the lower bound. So there is a differentiation within that category. We also said last time that we will respond fle ibly to new challenges as they arise and we can consider new instruments. And of course we told you that we considered new instruments and we actually did it, because we did introduce the Transmission Protection Instrument in 2022. And then the last sentence is important because this is where a lot of the discussion in the last year has been. It is to look back at these this set of instruments and on a forward basis say, in the future, if we ever came to these situations, how would we use these instruments? So we say in this important sentence: the choice of which one we use or which combination we use, the design – because on day zero, we usually have a press release or a legal act saying here’s the design of our instrument – and the implementation. So in other words, month by month, how we adjust it and how we bring it to an end in terms of e it. All of these, number one, will enable an agile response to new shocks. So let’s not get locked into rigid programmes that would inhibit our ability to respond to new shocks. They will reflect the intended purpose. So there can be differences between a stance-orientated intervention and a transmission-smoothing-type intervention. And then, of course, all of these will be subject to a comprehensive proportionality assessment. So in considering the choice of tools, the design and the implementation, we need the checklist of whether this is proportional to the challenge we face. So that’s, as I say, the toolbo . Then paragraph 9 is e plaining how we make decisions. A lot of this is similar to last time. Last time we basically had to tell you that we’ve decided, rather than having a two-pillar strategy where we have an economic pillar and a monetary pillar, we make an integrated assessment. And in that integrated assessment, for e ample, we take into account macro-financial linkages, financial stability and so on. So a lot of that remains, but maybe you might find this new sentence interesting. The second sentence is that in how we make decisions, we take into account not only the most likely path for inflation in the economy, i.e. in a projection for the baseline, we don’t just look at the baseline, but also the surrounding risks and uncertainty. How do we do that? Including through the appropriate use of scenario and sensitivity analysis. This is something we have done forever, but it’s probably true that it’s not always visible in how we communicate. And also internally, of course, the science of how you should do scenarios and the science of how you should make sure your decisions are robust is always evolving. So we do want to make this clear. And in fairness for you and for others watching us, you can say “I think I understand this decision in the conte t of the baseline, but I have a natural question: is it also robust to the risk assessment of the ECB?” And I think that will be a step forward in the conversation about monetary policy. By the way, this is already reflected, importantly, because, as you may have noticed, what we’ve said in the last couple of years is that we make our decisions not only based on the inflation outlook, but also in relation to underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission. Because those two dimensions capture a lot of risk. Underlying inflation captured a lot of risk when we were bringing inflation down from 10% to 2%. The strength of monetary transmission captured a lot of risk as we moved interest rates, first of all, steeply upwards and then as we’ve been reversing. So the logic behind the three-pronged reaction function that we’ve been using reflects these principles. Paragraph 10 reaffirms, and I think everything we’ve learnt from the last four years validates the assessment that, in terms of price stability, climate change has profound implications in terms of the structure of the economy, the rise and fall of particular sectors, the cycle, including through the impact of weather shocks, and also in terms of how the financial system is adjusting. This is also a policy priority for the European Union and a global challenge. So we are committed to ensuring the Eurosystem fully takes into account, in line with the EU’s goals and objectives, the implications of climate change and nature degradation for monetary policy and central banking. We added – because we’ve already added it elsewhere – “and nature degradation” because essentially it’s the same headache. And in terms of our economic analysis, you’ve also seen it in our publications. The same underlying failure to incorporate the global public good of a sustainable environment permeates that. Paragraph 11 reaffirms that clear communication is centre stage of our policymaking. We want effective communication at all levels. And this is why we think the layered and visualised approach to monetary policy communication is essential. Also, we want to adapt in this rapidly changing communication landscape. There’s more on that in the overview note. And, as you know, the ECB has been rolling out new types of communication, including Espresso Economics on YouTube in recent times. And then maybe in line with the idea that it’s good housekeeping to have a regular calendar-based commitment, the next assessment of the appropriateness of the strategy will be in 2030. My first question is for President Lagarde. Tell us about the learning points. What would you do differently if you could go back? The second is for Mr Lane. Would you say that the bar for QE will be higher in the future than it was in the past? I mean about launching it and about keeping it running, knowing what you know now. Christine Lagarde: What have we learnt and what do we do differently going forward? Because I remind you that the strategy e ercise that we’ve conducted is really to take stock, understand, appreciate the shortfalls and the upside of what we had planned and then, looking forward, see what needs to be improved. And I would say that given the e ercise that was conducted in 2021, which was thorough, deep, drew on all the competences around the whole Eurosystem and produced, I think, 18 occasional papers from 13 workstreams, if you remember. Now you only have two occasional papers. So, given that the depth and the very broad ranging that was conducted in 2021, there is a lot that is still completely valid today. As Philip has e plained, some of the paragraphs in what I call the “12 commandments” are still perfectly valid. But I would say that the e ercise that we conducted in 2021, although we had the 2% symmetric target in the medium term and we had a lot of the tools that have been identified – not quite all – was probably more influenced by the past that we had gone through. And as a result, if you look at the conclusions, there’s an element of ELB [effective lower bound] about the strategy e ercise of 2021. Given that we went through that rollercoaster sequence of very low inflation rate, very high inflation rate, and have now managed to bring inflation under control back to our target, I think the virtue of the strategy is that it’s a strategy for all circumstances. It is well informed by the 2021 e ercise, if ever there is another ELB moment and an effective lower bound where the number of instruments we can use is limited and needs to be far-fetched in a way. But we are also well equipped for what we have seen, which is much higher inflation. And that led to, I think, one of the key changes that Philip Lane has identified, which is this two-sided reaction function in order to avoid what is undesirable downside and what is undesirable upside. So that brings me to say we are equipped for all circumstances. Philip R. Lane: I think the toolbo paragraph, as you might imagine, both last time and this time was carefully considered. And I think it’s also important to remember with QE – and this is why we’re more e plicit this time – there are two very different scenarios. One is monetary policy stance: we’re getting close to the lower bound and, if we assess that there is a sustained material deviation from 2%, we have a list. So we list out at that point and say “what’s in the choice set?” We could look at asset purchases, we could look at long-term refinancing operations, we could look at rate forward guidance, we could look at negative interest rates. So here’s our menu and let us go through the list of pros and cons in terms of effectiveness, agility, side effects. I’m not going to get into one-liner-type summaries because of course it’s decisive in what e act conte t are you talking about? They’re unconventional for a reason. They’re all inferior to using the policy rate for the stance. So that’s one scenario: you’re running out of room on the rate and then you have to turn. I would say, by the way, compared with five years ago, we do say in the overview note that probably the equilibrium real rate has nudged up a bit – not super high. So, in other words, the probability of hitting the lower bound is probably lower than it was five years ago. So it remains a concern, but it’s not necessarily at the level we had five years ago. In any event, that’s one set of issues. No easy choices, but any future edition of the Governing Council has to go through that. The strategy will say: here’s your list, here’s how you make decisions about using them, agility, side effects, effectiveness and so on. In the overview note, it also says quite often a combination is more effective. So rather than overloading any one instrument, using a package of instruments can be more effective. The other element is for market-smoothing transmission. Sometimes you do need to go in and replace if the private sector is e iting, but that can look very different. And how we design a pure market-smoothing-type intervention would look quite different than a kind of a stance-type intervention. And then with the commitment to making sure any new programme is agile, I’m sure any future time we do QE, no matter whether it’s for stance or for smoothing or for some combination – remember, the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) was a combination of both – the way we write it in terms of the programme, in terms of making sure it’s agile, that will definitely look different, because last time we keyed the end of some of these programmes to shortly before we raised rates. But I’m sure we’re going to have a more e pansive way of thinking about when we stop, including this basic idea of scenario analysis – that, in other words, it’s not just about under the baseline, but also in line with the evolving risk assessment. It would e pand the way we think about the future, not just going into QE, but coming out of QE. I’m sure it will look different. I have a question on a side phrase you actually said in the first part of the statement – that changes in the international financial system will have effects on how to actually forecast inflation as well. What do you have in mind when you say that? Which changes are there? And also I would love to hear from you what you think will be the effects from AI usages across the whole spectrum. Will it rather be disinflationary or will it push prices up? What is your early gauge? Philip R. Lane: What I would say is we did write the financial system last time. And honestly, what we would have had in mind is, for e ample, the shift between banks and non-banks. We’ve generalised it to the international financial system because, first of all, even that – banks versus non-banks – there’s a big global component because, of course, typically the non-banking world has many currencies in their portfolios. So that’s one element. I mean, honestly, from my point of view, it also includes what we’ve seen this year. This year we’ve seen the euro appreciate, and that’s clearly reflecting a shift in global investor preferences. So that’s a very basic e ample. We also put in later in that paragraph that a more resilient European financial architecture would help to support monetary policy. So again, I think the world would look different with savings and investments union, banking union. And I’m not saying from the point of view of monetary policy transmission, but in terms of protecting the monetary autonomy of the euro area, the digital euro, I think, is important for that. Christine Lagarde: I totally agree with what Philip just said. I would add that we just have to be alert to changes that are taking place and will be taking place in the financial sector. And I think that the emergence of new payment mechanisms – and here I’m thinking about some of the most recent developments in stablecoins, for instance – will have an impact on the financial sector as well. And to the e tent that our monetary transmission is relying heavily on the financial sector, we have to be very attentive to how that is going to restructure the existing channels of transmission that we are used to. It might very well, and we have to be attentive to that. On artificial intelligence, we could spend the next day discussing that. Two things: one is I think we are more and more – all of us, central banks around the world, but certainly at the ECB – using artificial intelligence in multiple dimensions and for multiple applications. And I think the principle that we try to apply for that is being e tremely cautious and attentive in how it is used and how it is validated and what data it relies upon. So not blindly following artificial intelligence-produced models or results from them, but checking and verifying. So trust but verify, as famously quoted by Ronald Reagan, is certainly one that that would apply to our own use of artificial intelligence. As far as the economy is concerned, it is going to be transformational. How heavy it will be in terms of investment, how it will disseminate, how the business models will form and what impact it will have on labour, what productivity gains there will be, I think, is highly speculative, and you will find opinions in the literature at the right and the left end of that range. And if you remember last year in Sintra actually, we had some really interesting and insightful views about how transformational it would be and what impact it would have. I’d like to know how the updated strategy will influence the upcoming rate decisions. For e ample, will there be even more focus on the medium term versus the dip below the target in 2026, so maybe reducing the need for another cut? And second, on the implication of the international role of the euro – you have been very vocal on that recently. How would a bigger role for the euro influence the monetary policy of the ECB or its strategy? There are discussions about structural overvaluation of the currency. There are discussions about lower borrowing costs for governments and companies. What is your assessment on that point? Christine Lagarde: On your first question, I’ll let Philip take you backstage so that you appreciate how the work is done, how the analysis is conducted on the basis of these proposed changes that have been approved unanimously, by the way, by the Governing Council in terms of what tools we have, how they inform each other, how much weight we give to risk and the role of scenario analysis. So Philip will take you backstage so you understand how decisions are thought through. But on the international role of the euro, I would like to refer you to a speech that I gave in Berlin about two weeks ago in which I identified and articulated very clearly the three key components which any international currency should have if it wants to be one of the reserve currencies. And that spans from a geopolitical role, an economic role and legal certainty. And I think on the three accounts, as I said in that particular speech, we are well positioned, but we have work to do. And I know that, typically, the cynical view is: well, maybe, but why? Well, maybe, we shall see. But one thing that I know we shall do as a central bank is deliver on the mandate that we have: provide the beacon of certainty in a world that is vastly uncertain. We will deliver on our mandate. We will commit to that price stability. And when people in the economic sphere ponder what is solid, what is not solid, we want them to appreciate that what we do is solid and the outcome of our work is robust. The rest is going to belong to other decision-makers and other policymakers. But I think that there is a path. And that path will impact us as well, if we move forward in terms of banking union, even further than crisis management and deposit insurance, which is now agreed among the European Member States, if we move further than small steps on capital markets union, if the concepts that abound at the moment in terms of safe European assets prosper, then we shall see each other next year and some progress will have been made on that route to a broader international role of the euro. Philip R. Lane: First of all, I’ll say both between the 2021 statement and now, that gives you already a lot more conte t for how we make decisions. Before that, you have to go back to 2003, I think, to the last review. And remember, I joined the Governing Council in 2015 as governor of the Central Bank of Ireland. So I remember the ancient history as well. And what I would say is: honestly, outside the ECB people were trying to invert or reverse engineer how we make decisions. For e ample, they might say your decision’s driven by the point estimate at the last year in the forecast. That was a popular way. You just need to look at one number and that drives the decision. But never has that been a good guide, because it’s always the case that central banks take into account risk and uncertainty. So it’s very important to look at how we go from here into 2026 and into 2027. In December, we’ll be looking at 2028. But no matter what the projection horizon is, we’re always going to be keeping an eye out, because some of these dynamics will also play out longer. And so what we’re going to be doing – and this is why we are very data-dependent, meeting-by -meeting – number one is some of the big drivers of the forecast, like how we’ve seen a lot of volatility in energy markets recently, we have the e change rate. So there are going to be updates on that meeting-by-meeting. But then one of the big issues in the economic occasional paper is this issue about how shocks get transmitted across the economy. And the reality is there’s going to be a long period now, which I think was also in the Bank for International Settlements conversations this weekend, when the old assumptions that essentially a lot of firms would just absorb cost increases without responding, which was true for a long time, but then in the pandemic they responded by raising prices. So the issue now is we have had a big movement in energy prices, a significant movement in the e change rate, among other factors. What we do not know now, but we will be learning month by month is: is this widening across the economy? Are we seeing the service sectors that use a lot of energy adjust their pricing and so on? So nothing is precooked. A lot is going to turn on how these shocks to the economy permeate. You will have heard many people comment over the years that it’s always 2% at the end of the projection horizon, but that’s a common feature of central banking. Another big influence is basically our monetary policy. So the reason why we have 2% in 2027, a big reason, is that people believe us. People believe that we will do what’s needed to bring inflation back to 2% in the medium term. And so when we make a forecast, it’s embedded that monetary policy will respond appropriately to the shocks. So in other words, I’d imagine most of the time you will see 2% in the medium term. That doesn’t mean it falls from heaven. It means monetary policy will adjust and that any short-term deviation will not be permitted to be sustained. So what I would say is the question is: “What do we need to do?” And what we need to do will depend on the incoming data, our assessment – is this is a sustained deviation from our target? If we didn’t respond, would it get embedded? There’s a big checklist and what I would say is that we would like to try and give you as much as we can in terms of information in the projections on top of what we say as the Governing Council. There is a projections article afterwards. There are many blogs, working papers and so on. But we also don’t publish plenty of material because it needs to remain confidential in a good preparation for the meeting. At a confidential level, we go through many “what if” scenarios. We do many sensitivity analyses. The staff publish, in the projections article, what happens if the e change rate is at the 25th or 75th percentile, what happens if energy prices move. But we do far more than that. This remains ongoing work. And so it sounds super simple as long as inflation is at 2% in the medium term, but behind that is: what do we need to do to maintain that, to protect that anchor? Given the international conte t since the last review – COVID, wars, trade – how does the ECB respond to critics who say that it should significantly change the toolbo instead of trying to keep it the same? Christine Lagarde: We take critics and criticism, and we are actually quite used to it, but we pay attention because obviously it identifies where the perception by others than those backstage making the decision is. And if there is a perception that there is a shortfall, that there is something that hasn’t worked, then we look at it and we take that into account. So during the various crises and the major shocks that were in a way successive but also compounded, we responded and I think we demonstrated great agility in responding to those shocks and to this line of shocks. For e ample, we came up with a new instrument that simply didn’t e ist at the time: the Transmission Protection Instrument that we came up with in July 2022, it didn’t e ist, it wasn’t in the toolbo . The other instruments that we worked on weren’t needed eventually, but that’s what we do because we’re guided by the mandate that we have been given, the target that we have decided and we fle ibly and with agility respond to new situations. But the beauty of the e ercise that we’ve conducted, I think, is to take stock and keep what was to be kept from 2021, but also look at what we learnt from the last four years and improve the instruments that needed to be improved in order to refine the projections, arrive at better proposals and have even more robust recommendations. I think the e ample that Philip just gave, where of course the baseline is decisive and of course we have regularly conducted scenario analysis and of course we have conducted sensitivity analysis, but I think that the change that Philip has identified is that it’s not going to be the scenario analysis with a few e ogenous causes, as we have done in the last four big published scenario analyses. We’re going to go deeper than that and anticipate the transformation that will affect the economy going forward and we will test what we are proposing against those scenarios and inform the baseline that still remains decisive with those scenario analyses. I hope I’ve addressed your question. Could you give us a little bit more colour on how to really make sense of this increased focus on the fact that you will also fight inflation forcefully and persistently when it goes up? But at the same time you stress, Philip, that you will only do so if it’s not a blip, but a persistent and permanent trend. If we travel back in time to 2021 and 2022, I think the problem back then wasn’t that the ECB said “we won’t fight inflation if it’s going up persistently”, but for quite a long time it was thought that it’s not a persistent thing. So if the current approach had applied back then, would it have been different or not? As a learning e ercise more than as an implicit criticism. And my second question is on the toolbo . You stress that the unconventional tools are still part of the toolbo and then you give some e amples of what those instruments are, but it’s clearly not a closed list. So are there any tools that are off limits, and if so, which are they? Was this discussed in the strategy review or is basically everything possible if you think it’s necessary? Christine Lagarde: I just want to remind you that we believe collectively as a Governing Council that any significant or material deviation from our inflation target on the way up and on the way down: full symmetry. You only talked about inflation on the way up. So, it’s full symmetry. And the response is of course going to be conte t-specific and is going to be a two-sided response to avoid the material deviation that we do not want. It’s undesirable at both ends. Philip R. Lane: If you take a longer history of the ECB, it’s probably fair to say as inflation fell below 2% ten years ago, the ECB did take some time to say whether it was a material sustained deviation or whether it will self-correct. The issue about making the call that this is something that warrants a monetary policy reaction, this is why I don’t think we’re going to be replaced quite yet by the AI. It’s going to require a lot of work, a lot of judgement in both directions. And fundamentally, I think we definitely had a baseline in 2021 and even in early 2022 that essentially there would be a reversion back to target fairly quickly and therefore there was not a big monetary policy call. So then the question is the risk assessment. At the time, and I went back to the 1970s and 1980s and there were papers about non-linear adjustment, but there was, for a while, maybe not so much evidence that the non-linear adjustment was taking over, but then by summer it was very much in our face. So now we know that the whole pandemic is going to leave a legacy because we have a concrete e ample now where actually the non-linearity has moved from being theory to being actually visible. And there’s a plausibility now that people are more used to raising prices, there’s a plausibility that maybe that can kick in even in different circumstances in the future. So what I would say is we didn’t spend our time going back and doing a genuine kind of full-scale, put ourselves back in that position and see, because I think that’s impossible to do. What’s important is to learn from the episode. What I would say is with this new strategy we are, if you like, pre-committing here that whatever we decide to do is based not just on the baseline, but also on the risk assessment. So you collectively will be asking us: “Your decision looks OK under the baseline, e plain to me how it’s also robust – as far as it can be robust – under the risk assessment.” So I think that is the difference because that was maybe not the way the conversation was at that time. And maybe just to join the President again, this issue is working out. What I would say is what we already heard the last time – the scale of the monetary policy response depends on the scale of the problem. Sometimes you need to campaign, with a campaign then going from -50 to +400 over a year. That was a big campaign. We’ve had a big campaign since then. Where we are now is we’ve come back to target and we’ve brought rates down a lot. So sometimes you have a campaign and sometimes you’re in cyclical management, you’re nudging in response to smaller-scale risk assessments. So hopefully we’re in a calmer world, but we’re not signing up to any assessment of where we’re going. And let me come back to this issue, because the temptation is to say: is AI going to be net inflationary? That’s not the way to think about any of these. The way to think about it is it creates uncertainty. We do think it creates volatility and honestly with most of these, I can see scenarios where in one time period it’s downside, in another scenario it’s upside. So all of this is basically stuff we have to integrate, but it’s not leading us to a universal net message. With AI right now there’s a lot of investment in data centres and so on. We’re in an investment phase. At a different phase, we could be in a productivity-enhancing phase where they really are lowering costs in the economy. And the e act time periods where either the demand side or the supply side dominates, that’s going to be the subject we’re going to have to watch for in the coming years. You talked about the world becoming more unpredictable, possibly more volatile. Why not review the strategy more frequently? Why not have even more reviews rather than waiting till 2030 because of some of the trade-offs there. And then to bring us back to climate, the language there still seemed quite forceful around the importance of climate change and thinking about these objectives – were there any reflections on the limitations of what the central bank can do in terms of also its own distribution of resources towards this issue in a more volatile world? Christine Lagarde: You actually addressed with your second question the response I was going to give you on the first, because if you’re proposing to the team which is sitting in the back of the room that we should do the strategy assessment every year, I think they’re going to have a fit because this is a massive e ercise. Each workstream had the coordination of about 200 experts, economists of all stripes from around the Eurosystem under the leadership of both Christophe and Christiane, who each had to harness the competence, the egos and come to some sensible conclusions that were then debated and put to the Governing Council for further iteration and eventually unanimous support. So it’s a massive e ercise. Second, the way in which it has been orchestrated and calibrated now, I think, gives us what I call a strategy for all circumstances or a strategy for all seasons. Whether we get way too high or way too low, the toolbo is there. The assessment that we will do is technically soundly based, as has been described, and we have our focus on stability, as we have defined, delivering target inflation, as we have defined it, with the same unequal tolerance for material deviation respectively from the downside or from the upside, with conte t-specific responses that we are characterising as two-sided responses. On climate, the inclusion of climate in 2021 was a bit of a breakthrough because not everyone was convinced. This particular time, there was a lot less debate as to the relevance of climate change as a component in our assessment of the economic situation, of the risk of inflation, of the price impact and of the risk management that we are accountable to European citizens when it comes to the validity of our monetary portfolio, but also of all the portfolios for non-monetary purposes as well. As you will have noted, we’ve added one word, which is nature degradation, which did not feature in the 2021 strategy. And that is just to follow suit from what has been clearly flagged by the European Commission as another component of the same disaster that we’re facing.",

Many thanks to the Institute for Applied Economic Research and my colleagues from Stuttgart for organising this event. Let me start with a quote. I acknowledge that our strategy is comple . However, we have to recognise that we live in a rather comple economic world (-). It would therefore be impossible for the Eurosystem to conduct a successful policy by mechanistically following a simple rule (-). The person who said this would have celebrated his 90th birthday today. It was Wim Duisenberg, the first President of the European Central Bank (ECB). Unfortunately, the Dutchman passed away back in 2005, not long after the end of his presidency. He played a key role in the successful establishment of the ECB's reputation as a credible and stability-oriented central bank. This success was due not least to the ECB's monetary policy strategy.

Central bank speech | 10 July 2025 by Piero Cipollone PDF full te t (156kb) | 8 pages It is a pleasure to speak to you today. The ongoing shift in the way we pay is affecting the fundamental fabric of our economies. Whether we are consumers browsing digital marketplaces, entrepreneurs pursuing digital innovation, or decision-makers facing the digital transition, we are all involved in reshaping payments. Payments are more than a means of settling transactions, they are the lifeblood of a modern economy. And in a digital world, our economies will only be as competitive, inclusive, autonomous and resilient as our payments are. Slovenia has put the digital transformation at the heart of its economic strategy, aiming to place the country among the top five most digitalised economies in Europe by 2030. An innovative and striving digital payments ecosystem can play a key role in this journey. As a central bank, our responsibility is to accompany and enable this transition. We must ensure that the shift to digital payments enhances accessibility and efficiency, without creating fragmentation or new dependencies.

I will start with the monetary policy stance before turning to our updated monetary policy strategy. I will then briefly discuss the euro area bond market before concluding with a monetary perspective on the digital euro project. The monetary policy stance In a recent speech, I assessed that the challenge of returning inflation to the target after the inflation surges can be considered to be largely complete. The orientation now for the monetary policy stance is to make sure that the current shocks and prospective new shocks hitting the economy do not lead to medium-term deviations of inflation from our two per cent target. In terms of significant data developments in recent months, there has been a marked drop in energy prices and a substantial appreciation of the euro. These forces played an important role in the June 2025 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. In addition, the fiscal outlook has materially changed for the coming years, with the overall fiscal deficit looking set to remain above three per cent over the projection horizon.

Central bank speech | 10 July 2025 by Elizabeth Genia PDF full te t (6kb) | 3 pages Hon Deputy Prime Minister, Hon. Minister Kilepa, Executive Director Ms Duarte, Distinguished Members of the Green Climate Fund Board, Development Partners and Dear Friends, Good evening to you All It has been our pleasure to welcome you to our nation's capital, Port Moresby. On behalf of the Bank of Papua New Guinea and all who have been involved this week, thank you for being here and for bringing your commitment, your questions, your e pertise, and above all, your shared purpose. We never take for granted what it means for Papua New Guinea to host a gathering like this. It matters deeply to us that voices from Small Island Nations can be heard - not just in technical sessions or in written submissions, but with a seat at the table - in our own region - and with our own perspectives guiding the conversation. In PNG, climate change is not a distant concept. It is lived daily - along our coastlines - in our flood-prone valleys - and among our communities working to protect the forests that store carbon for the world. When the Board of the Green Climate Fund makes room for countries like ours to contribute as thought partners, it sends a powerful message to us that you know - and you understand - the path we are travelling on. We are sincerely grateful for the GCF's funding of 63 million dollars to assist with PNG's efforts to manage our forests more sustainably. This support will have a real impact. Not just for the environment, but for the livelihoods and wellbeing of the many people involved in sustainable forest management activities in Papua New Guinea. It is an important contribution to global climate mitigation efforts and we commend the GCF for its unwavering leadership in driving global efforts toward climate-resilient development. The deliberations this week have also reinforced the essential role institutions like the GCF play in ensuring that countries such as ours can access the support and resources necessary to tackle the climate crisis. As a Central Bank, the Bank of PNG never imagined we would one day be leading green finance programs. But as we've listened and learned, especially from other countries in our region, we've come to understand that if climate resilience is to be real, it must run through our entire economic system. It must embrace the way we manage risk, regulate banks and think about growth. We now recognize both the systemic risks of climate change and the powerful role that finance can play in mitigating them. For Small Island Developing States (SIDS), resilience is not merely aspirational it is e istential and Central Banks must take an active role in enabling the transition to low-emission, climate-resilient economies while safeguarding financial system stability. Strategic alliances with development partners are essential and I would also like to acknowledge the invaluable support and strategic partnerships of some other key development allies including the Australian and New Zealand Governments, the French Development Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, and the Global Green Growth Institute. With the help of our development partners, we have made some remarkable progress in laying the foundation for a sustainable finance ecosystem. We launched our national Green Ta onomy, introduced our Inclusive Green Finance Policy, and established the Green Finance Centre under the Bank of Papua New Guinea to lead and coordinate our efforts. Earlier this year, we hosted our inaugural Green Finance Summit, bringing international agencies, private investors, and domestic financial institutions together to align on a national climate finance roadmap. These collaborations have helped us take practical steps, small at first, but building momentum; the momentum has been e traordinary - and it continues to grow. Under our Sustainable Finance Roadmap, we are advancing two flagship green financial instruments: the Green Refinancing Facility and the Green Guarantee Facility. Scheduled to go live by August 2025, these facilities will help de-risk and unlock climate-aligned lending across the banking sector. We are also developing thematic bond guidance, with the aim of PNG's first green bond issuance in 2026 a significant step towards diversifying our financing tools. Papua New Guinea's green finance roadmap is strongly aligned with the GCF's strategic priorities; particularly in unlocking private capital, building institutional capacity, and supporting the market for green finance instruments in countries vulnerable to climate change. None of these initiatives is about making a grand announcement. It is about moving, steadily and with purpose, towards systems that serve both the people and the planet. It has also meant asking ourselves hard questions. About equity, about access, and about how to create conditions where private capital can work for public good, without losing sight of the needs of the most vulnerable. We know we're still learning. But we hope our e perience might offer something useful to others, just as we've drawn so much from the e amples and encouragement of fellow SIDS (small island developing states) and developing nations who are walking similar paths. To the GCF Board: thank you for spending this time with us. For listening, for challenging and for believing that it is possible to shift the centre of gravity in climate finance to places like the Pacific, where the stakes are high; but the commitment to our combined global efforts to tackling climate change runs deep. Please enjoy the rest of your stay in Port Moresby, and safe travels as you return home. Tenkiu tru.

The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 10 July 2025 by P Nandalal Weerasinghe PDF full te t (12kb) | 5 pages It is with profound honor and privilege that I address this distinguished assembly today as we mark a pivotal milestone in Sri Lanka's financial inclusion progression - the launch of transformative initiatives under our Financial Literacy Roadmap. These groundbreaking programs embody our steadfast commitment to equipping every Sri Lankan with the essential knowledge, competencies, and mindset required to navigate the comple ities of modern finance with confidence and wisdom. A Strategic Foundation for Financial Inclusion The Central Bank of Sri Lanka, empowered by the provisions of the new Central Bank Act No. 16 of 2023, has embraced the mandate of promoting financial inclusion as a fundamental pillar of our institutional mission. While our dedication to financial inclusion spans decades of continuous effort, 2021 marked a paradigmatic shift as we launched Sri Lanka's inaugural National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), developed in strategic partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC). This comprehensive framework provided us with an ambitious vision, clearly defined objectives, and quantifiable benchmarks to enhance financial accessibility across every segment of our diverse society. A defining achievement under the NFIS was the introduction of Sri Lanka's pioneering Financial Literacy Roadmap in May of last year. This meticulously crafted document establishes a comprehensive, long-term framework designed to achieve measurable advances in financial awareness, behavioral transformation, and overall economic wellbeing. The implementation of this roadmap benefits from the invaluable strategic and technical e pertise of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Addressing the Critical Gap: From Knowledge to Action Today marks another transformative milestone as we operationalize one of the Roadmap's most critical pillars: Content Development and Harmonization. This strategic focus addresses a fundamental challenge that has long hindered our collective progress. While numerous institutions, including the Central Bank, have maintained active roles in promoting financial literacy, e perience has demonstrated that fragmented approaches and sporadic interventions are insufficient to catalyze the profound, sustainable behavioral changes our society requires. Previous surveys revealed that while many Sri Lankans possess adequate financial knowledge, significant behavioral gaps persist-evidenced by concerning patterns of over-indebtedness, inadequate budgeting practices, insufficient savings culture, and susceptibility to financial fraud. This reality underscores a crucial truth: knowledge alone is insufficient; we must cultivate appropriate skills and attitudes that empower Sri Lankans to make prudent, informed and rational financial decisions. Today's initiatives directly address these challenges with unprecedented scope and precision. Sri Lanka's First Comprehensive Financial Literacy Curriculum I am delighted to unveil Sri Lanka's first comprehensive Financial Literacy Curriculum-a foundational resource meticulously designed to guide all future financial education endeavors nationwide. This comprehensive curriculum encompasses seven essential domains: The Economic Environment Financial Environment Personal Financial Management Financial Management for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Digital Financial Literacy Financial Consumer Protection Ta Literacy The development of this curriculum represents a collaborative achievement of e ceptional distinction, benefiting from the technical e pertise of the University of Kelaniya. The content was developed through extensive consultation with key Central Bank departments and e ternal subject matter experts, ensuring accuracy, contemporary relevance, and practical adaptability. We e tend our profound gratitude to the UNDP, whose generous financial and technical support transformed this vision into reality. This curriculum will be made publicly accessible in all three national languages through the Central Bank website, ensuring universal accessibility. We envision widespread adoption by educational institutions, vocational training centers, public agencies, and financial educators, thereby creating unprecedented consistency, credibility, and scalability across Sri Lanka's financial literacy ecosystem. Educational Video Series: Addressing Real-World Challenges We are equally pleased to launch two comprehensive educational video series, developed through the generous support of the UNDP and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). These professionally produced resources address prevalent financial challenges affecting our communities, including: Over-indebtedness and debt management Impulsive spending behaviors Savings habit development Risks associated with unauthorized deposit-taking schemes Recognition and avoidance of pyramid scams I e tend a sincere invitation to all media institutions, content creators, and social media influencers to join this vital mission. Your platforms possess the power to amplify our message and cultivate responsible financial behaviors across every community throughout Sri Lanka. Professional Certification: The CTFL Programme Recognizing that delivering consistent, high-quality financial education requires skilled professionals, we proudly introduce the Certified Trainer in Financial Literacy (CTFL) programme. This innovative initiative, developed jointly by the Central Bank's Regional Development Department and the Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka (IBSL), aligns perfectly with our content harmonization objectives. The programme aims to certify 100 trainers annually, with particular emphasis on public sector and banking professionals across all regions of our nation. Our Vision: Towards a Financially Literate Sri Lanka These integrated efforts-curriculum development, public outreach through multimedia content, and capacity building through professional certification-collectively advance our inspiring vision: \"Towards a Financially Literate Sri Lanka.\" A financially literate citizen transcends the role of mere consumer; they become an empowered individual capable of making informed financial decisions, protecting themselves from fraud, planning strategically for the future, and ultimately contributing to inclusive economic growth and financial system stability. Financial literacy serves as a powerful instrument for reducing over-indebtedness, alleviating poverty, and breaking intergenerational poverty cycles. Informed access to financial services enables individuals to manage their resources more effectively, save strategically for the future, and invest in opportunities that enhance their economic prospects. Over time, this reduces dependence on government-funded social security programmes. A forward-looking perspective on financial literacy emphasizes equipping future generations with essential financial capabilities, ensuring they possess the resilience to navigate economic challenges as adults. Thus, investing in financial literacy represents an investment with e ceptional social and economic returns. Strategic Alignment with Central Bank Objectives Our commitment to building a financially literate Sri Lanka is intrinsically linked to the Central Bank's core objectives. When individuals make sound, rational decisions regarding spending, borrowing, saving, and investing, they become less susceptible to financial distress, over-indebtedness, or e ploitation by unauthorized entities. This enhanced financial resilience reduces systemic risks and strengthens the stability of our financial institutions. Furthermore, when citizens understand economic variables such as inflation, interest rates, and currency movements, the transmission of monetary policy becomes more effective, aligning public behavior with national economic objectives. Financial literacy also strengthens public confidence in financial institutions. Informed consumers are more likely to engage with the formal financial sector and hold financial service providers accountable for ethical and responsible conduct. In this manner, financial literacy supports both market discipline and inclusive growth toward a sustainable economy. Acknowledgments and Partnerships The initiatives launched today represent the transformation of aspiration into concrete action. Their success depends upon the efficient, effective, and active support of our stakeholders, media partners, and generous donors. I firmly believe that through continued collaboration, we can achieve meaningful and lasting progress. I e tend heartfelt gratitude to the University of Kelaniya for their invaluable technical e pertise and partnership. We eagerly anticipate deepening this collaboration through the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to be e ecuted today, which will further enhance our joint efforts in promoting financial literacy across our nation. Allow me to e press our sincere appreciation to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which has provided unwavering support since the inception of our Financial Literacy Roadmap implementation. We are equally grateful to the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for their steadfast commitment. We look forward to continuing our collaborative efforts to realize the anticipated outcomes of this transformative initiative. I also acknowledge all stakeholder institutions, including the dedicated departments of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, for their e ceptional contributions. Your commitment and dedication will create lasting positive impact on the lives of countless Sri Lankans. A Collective Journey Forward We recognize that this endeavor represents a sustained journey requiring continuous effort and active participation from all sectors of society. Government ministries, regulatory bodies, educational institutions, the private sector, media organizations, development partners, and community-based organizations all play crucial roles in transforming this vision into reality. As we advance, I call upon all stakeholders to unite in this noble cause. Financial literacy must become a shared national responsibility-a collective commitment to our people's prosperity and our nation's economic resilience. Moving forward, we will depend upon this broad-based coalition to drive our mission: implementing the financial literacy curriculum, promoting educational videos and outreach materials, supporting the CTFL programme, and continuously evaluating and refining our collective impact. Conclusion Let us continue working together, united in purpose and unwavering in commitment, to build a financially aware, resilient, and empowered Sri Lanka. Together, we will create a legacy of economic empowerment that will benefit generations to come. Thank you for your attention, your partnership, and your dedication to this transformative journey.

Central bank speech | 10 July 2025 by Erik Thedéen PDF full te t (234kb) | 10 pages I would like to thank SEB for this invitation and the opportunity to share my thoughts on what is needed for a functioning savings and investment union within the EU, based on e periences from Sweden and the Nordic-Baltic region. It will come as no surprise to anyone in this room that financing needs in Europe are substantial. Mario Draghi assesses the need for e tra investments in the EU to be almost 5 per cent of GDP per year, for the next 5 years. Both public and private investments will have to increase to satisfy this requirement. A large part of the financing for these investments will need to come through debt and equity capital markets. Unfortunately, it is an equally well-known fact that European capital markets are not yet up to this task. Compared to the US, they are dwarfed, especially our equity markets. For instance, US market capitalisation makes up 60 per cent of global market capitalisation, roughly three times more than the EU. US capital markets are not only bigger, but they are more liquid and vibrant with far more IPOs, both in number and in value. This is not only problematic for private companies and other actors demanding capital for investment purposes, with all the negative effects on growth and productivity that come with a lack of capital e penditure. It also means that European households are deprived of financial investment opportunities and thus receive a lower long-term return on their savings. This makes them relatively less wealthy than, for instance, their US counterparts, who invest in equities to a much greater e tent.

Happy anniversary. Our theme today is digital, sustainable, inclusive. These are not just buzzwords. They are principles that shape the way we think, we work, and the way we serve. But the center of it all is digitalization. It is everywhere. Now with artificial intelligence (AI), it is impossible to ignore. The growing conversation around AI is still evolving and so are the expectations. Goldman Sachs says there will be a significant 7-percent annual boost to GDP (gross domestic product) over the next 10 years. By contrast, Nobel Laureate, Daron Acemoglu sees a more modest gain of 1 percent a year. He cautioned that without thoughtful design AI would deepen inequality and centralize power. The truth likely lies somewhere in this region. This reminds me of Yogi Berra-the baseball player and coach. He said, when you come to a fork on the road, take it. We are now at that fork. The real question is not whether to adopt AI, it is about how we use it, to empower rather than to displace. To this end, we made some progress. In monetary policy we are leveraging generative AI to e tract insights from non-traditional, unstructured high-frequency data. These are especially helpful during periods of befuddling uncertainty. In banking supervision, SupTech and RegTech are helping us streamline reporting and assess risks faster. These are essential as banks become more comple and interconnected. In cybersecurity, we have launched ASTERisC*, rolled out the Financial Services Cyber Resilience Plan, and implementing the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act. This will enhance the BSP's (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) ability to combat cybercrimes. In payments, digital transactions have surpassed our 50 percent target. QR Ph was e panded to 178 local government units-encouraging broader adoption among small merchants and accelerating financial inclusion. Likewise, Bills Pay PH has simplified payments for recurring bills like utilities and credit cards. We have also made important strides for BSP. After all, technology is only as good as the people who use it. As of this week, our refreshed website offers a faster and more responsive e perience. At 32, we are not just marking time, we are charting our direction. One, powered by innovation and rooted in sustainability and inclusion. So, as we stand at this fork, let us not hesitate. Let us take it together with purpose and with target. Happy anniversary. Magandang umaga po!

The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 10 July 2025 by Yannis Stournaras PDF full te t (14kb) | 6 pages Good morning, everyone. Many thanks to the organisers for inviting me here today. It's a pleasure to be part of this distinguished panel. Heraclitus, the Greek philosopher, famously asserted \"everything changes, and nothing stays\". This observation is valid across all aspects of life, and central banking is no e ception. It was not that long ago when monetary policy was thought to be a policy instrument with limited influence, even by central bankers. One notable central banker who held that view was Arthur Burns, who was Federal Reserve Chairman in the 1970s. And so, when inflation started rising in the United States following the first oil price shock in the early 1970s, Burns kept his foot on the monetary-policy gas pedal. U.S. President Ni on was facing re-election and Burns did not want to jeopardize Ni on's chances by allowing unemployment to rise. Burns advocated wage-price controls – and not monetary policy – as the best way to prevent inflation. What followed was the Great Inflation -- a combination of double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment rates. Not all central banks acted that way. Both the Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank, to name two notable e ceptions, tightened monetary policy in response to the 1970s oil price shocks. As a result, their economies escaped from the oil price shocks in much better condition, both in terms of inflation and in terms of unemployment, than that of the United States. That e perience taught central banks a lesson: monetary policy needs to focus on inflation if it wants to prevent stagflation – that is, a combination of high inflation and high unemployment. Today, no central banker would doubt that firm resolve is needed to tame inflation, even if, as in the period following the Covid shock, inflation was mainly supply-driven. Consequently, the evolution of thinking about what central banks can – and cannot – do has been profound during the past 50 years. I. The evolving central bank mandate Related to that, another significant change has been the adoption of price stability as the primary objective of central banks, reflecting the hard-learned lessons of the Great Inflation era in the 1970s, to which I just referred. And many central banks have been granted political independence. Those two developments are intrinsically connected, because e perience has shown that a politically independent central bank is best positioned to deliver price stability to its citizens. The European Central Bank (ECB) is a prime e ample of a central bank that is both independent and legally bound to achieve price stability. But the journey didn't end there. Fast forward to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). That profound shock revealed structural vulnerabilities in the financial system. In response, many central banks broadened their mandates to include e plicit financial stability objectives. Central banks were granted sole or co-responsibility for macroprudential tasks – effectively tools to prevent systemic risk. In the euro area, this translated into a monumental institutional development: the creation of the banking union, entrusting the direct supervision of significant banks to the ECB, in close cooperation with national authorities. This marked a pivotal step in strengthening financial stability, an important precondition for price stability. More recently, the post-pandemic inflation surge and other structural shifts reignited the debate around inflation targets and policy frameworks. The following question was addressed: are our current objectives, instruments, and operational frameworks truly fit for purpose in this highly uncertain and volatile world? Should we revise our mandate by integrating other considerations, without compromising the primary objective of price stability? II. The ECB's monetary policy strategy: a stability anchor My focus today will be on the Eurosystem. Our price stability mandate is enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. Why is this so vital? Because history has shown us the deep and lasting damage that can be caused by deviations from price stability. How we deliver on our mandate is defined by our monetary policy strategy. Central to this strategy is our unambiguous and symmetric 2% inflation target over the medium term. The point target was made e plicit in 2021. It replaced a more comple formulation, providing greater clarity. It offered a stable reference point that is easy for the public to understand, enhancing wage and price setting, thereby strengthening the anchoring of inflation expectations. Since its creation in 1999 and until the shocks of the early 2020s, the ECB delivered inflation close to 2% on average. This helped build credibility – a precious asset. Thanks to this credibility, even during the recent inflation surge, long-term expectations remained well anchored. That, in turn, allowed us to act forcefully to bring inflation back to target, while also achieving a soft landing of the economy. You might ask: why 2% and not zero? The answer lies in fle ibility. An inflation buffer above zero provides monetary policy with space for interest rate cuts in the event of adverse developments and with a safety margin against the risk of deflation. It also addresses issues like downward nominal rigidities and measurement bias. Several 1 academics and policymakers have called for raising the target above 2%. Such proposals have to be carefully weighed against potential risks to central bank credibility. 2 Frequent adjustments to the target risk undermining the credibility we have worked so hard to build. If markets e pect the target to keep shifting, inflation expectations could de-anchor, making our job much harder. Our focus on the medium term is equally important, as it gives us valuable fle ibility. Monetary policy acts with long and variable lags. A medium-term approach enables us to navigate inflationary or deflationary pressures in a stepwise, gradual manner - without overreacting in ways that might harm economic activity and employment. This approach allows us to look through short-lived supply-driven deviations of inflation from target, which are e pected to dissipate over time. An important strand of the literature e plores monetary policy implications from heterogenous developments in prices across sectors. Such approaches underscore the critical importance of delving into granular data to help the understanding of how prices are changing in the economy. At the ECB, inflation analysis includes a broad range of measures encompassing headline and various metrics of underlying inflation, to help us assess the dynamics and drivers of inflation. Our aim is to ensure that our policies are transmitted smoothly and effectively across member states and segments of the economy, in order to enhance the prosperity of our citizens. This is key in a monetary union where financial structures and economic conditions still differ widely. IΙΙ. Rethinking Mandates: Responding to Emerging Challenges Let me now turn to broader challenges that call for a forward-looking reassessment of central bank roles. Central banks do not operate in a vacuum. In the euro area, we must navigate a particularly comple environment. This environment is shaped by fragmented capital markets, persistent geopolitical tensions that impact energy markets and supply chains, the urgency of climate risks, and a pressing need to address the productivity gap vis-à-vis other major economic areas. Let me be clear: central banks are not the main actors in resolving these challenges. That responsibility lies primarily with governments and legislators in Europe. However, monetary policy has a vital supporting role: to provide an anchor of stability. By safeguarding our primary objective – maintaining low and predictable inflation – we secure a fundamental condition for sustainable growth. This, in turn, fosters confidence among households and firms, spurring investment and job creation. Over the past year, as inflation has eased, we have been able to largely remove policy restrictiveness. This easing in financing conditions will make capital more affordable and accessible, which is essential for investment in a time of very high uncertainty. The ECB has also been a frontrunner in contributing to some of these broader agendas. Within our mandate, we are actively integrating climate-related considerations into our operations, risk assessments, and supervisory and collateral frameworks. In our strategy assessment, climate remains a policy priority within our remit. Yet, there is something that cannot change: monetary policy cannot drive Europe's transformation alone. That's why we are pressing for progress in other areas, notably financial architecture. Such progress can support the effectiveness of our monetary policy, a point made clear also in our 2025 strategy assessment. To mobilize investment at the scale needed to re-invigorate growth and ensure that the benefits flow seamlessly across borders, we need to finalise the Banking Union and deepen the Capital Markets Union. A fully fledged \"Savings and Investments Union\" is essential. It will fundamentally improve how our financial system channels savings into productive investment, especially in critical areas like energy, defence, and innovation – all pressing priorities for our Union. A more integrated union will allow the euro to take on a greater role as an international currency. This means not only sharing in the benefits that come with that global status, but also stepping up to the responsibility that comes with it – especially at a time when the world is increasingly marked by uncertainty and division. Europe must rise to the occasion. The ECB is working towards the digital euro, a project that can strengthen the international role of our currency in the digital era. This initiative can increase efficiency, innovation and resilience while protecting our monetary sovereignty. The current institutional setup poses an important obstacle because the ECB essentially operates without a genuine fiscal counterpart at the euro area level. A permanent central fiscal capacity – a shared framework for managing public finances – would be a true turning point, enabling coordinated investment and shared responsibility for growth-enhancing initiatives. The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) could serve as a valuable blueprint for the future. The creation of a common European safe asset can be a key instrument for deepening financial integration and resilience across the euro area. This, along with the elimination of internal barriers which fragment the European market as described in the Letta Report and in various IMF studies, and are in fact equivalent to internal high tariffs, will increase the rate of return on domestic investment, leading to a higher investment ratio as suggested by the Draghi Report, thus closing the investment and productivity gap with the US. More ambitious proposals, such as the one recently put forward by Olivier Blanchard and Ángel Ubide, 3 deserve consideration: they could help create a deep and liquid EU bond market that could achieve greater global significance. ΙV. The Fiscal and Monetary interactions Let me elaborate more on the interplay between fiscal and monetary policy. An enabling force to the achievement of price stability and financial stability is sound fiscal policy that supports monetary policy. In the euro area, we learnt the hard way during the debt crisis that fiscal and monetary policies should be aligned, reinforcing each other. This could lead to more effective crisis resolution and stronger economic recovery, as e emplified in the handling of the pandemic. The optimal outcome arises when both policies are aligned, but critically, with a clear understanding of their respective roles, responsibilities, and mandates. Today, as political pressure builds in some jurisdictions to cut interest rates, coordination without subordination is paramount. It is critically important to maintain the central bank independence and ensure that policymakers can uphold their primary mandate of price stability. Conclusion To conclude, in a world of constant flu , central bank mandates are not written in stone. They are continuously evolving in response to significant challenges and shifting economic landscapes. Yet the foundation must remain firm. A firm, credible, clear commitment to price stability. This is our best contribution to economic growth, job creation and the welfare of our citizens. A more efficient architecture of the euro area can also play a vital role. Thank you for your time. I look forward to our discussion. 1 See Blanchard, O., Dell' Ariccia, G., & Mauro, P. (2010), \"Rethinking macroeconomic policy\", Journal of Money, Credit and Banking , 42 , 199-215; Ball, L.M.

The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 10 July 2025 by Gent Sejko PDF full te t (5kb) | 2 pages Dear Minister Minister of Finance, Dear representatives of the banking sector, Let me start by conveying my heartfelt thanks for your participation in this important roundtable discussion, co-organized with the Ministry of Finance. This event aims to identify the appropriate pathways and instruments for opening a new chapter regarding credit to the agricultural sector in Albania. As we have emphasized in many previous discussions and communication platforms, lending to the agricultural sector has been-and continues to be-a structural weakness for both our economy and banking sector. The comparison of the significant role that agriculture plays in the Albanian economy with the limited level of credit this sector receives from the banking sector, clearly illustrates this weakness. Agriculture accounts for around 20% of GDP of Albania and employs around 1/3 of population, yet it benefits less than 2% of total bank credit. Moreover, recent trends in the agricultural lending have not been encouraging. The underlying reasons of the low level of credit to the agricultural sector-ranging from property ownership issues and high levels of informality, to the relatively high business risk and low productivity due to the absence of economies of scale-have been consistently discussed. Some of these problems still remain relevant, while others are gradually being addressed. However, even in this challenging conte t - credit to the agricultural remains low. This deficiency must be addressed without further delay if we aim at boosting the stable development of this sector that is crucial for the Albanian economy. Against this backdrop, the Bank of Albania has aligned its Financing Programme to Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises to emphasize the growth of credit to the agricultural sector. This program, that involves all stakeholders in the banking sector, offers a reliable and sustainable source of low-cost funding to support lending of development projects in the agricultural sector, including agrotourism and the agro-food industry. Last, the Government of Albania has undertaken concrete steps in this regard, by making available a sovereign guarantee scheme for loans granted to the agriculture sector. This guarantee significantly mitigates the credit risk related with this sector, in turn considerably reducing one of the fundamental problems we have discussed, and the collateral. We deem that both development projects provide a solid platform for progressing further as we make a new qualitative step in lending to the agriculture. Nevertheless, the success of this platform considerably dependents on the involvement and the commitment to utilising its instruments. In this conte t, allow me to draw your attention to three important points. First, from the narrower perspective of the business interests you represent, I would like to highlight that the low level of lending to the agricultural sector should be considered equally both as a reflection of existing structural and operational problems, and as a potential indicator for the high returns you may have from investments in this sector. In light of this, I encourage you to give agricultural sector the attention and e pertise it rightly deserves. Second, from the perspective of the overall economic development, the growth of the agricultural sector-aligned and progressing in parallel with other sectors of the economy-should be regarded as a crucial pillar for the long-term and sustainable development of Albania. From this standpoint, as primary actors in Albania's economic and financial landscape, you are encouraged to view lending to the agricultural sector as a strategic investment that yields positive returns for the country's sustainable and inclusive growth. Third, as key actors in the social life of the country, the support to the agriculture sector should also be viewed as a moral obligation toward Albania, the country where you safely carry out your business and in a profitable manner. Supporting the food supply chain industry remains a factor of vital importance for a country and its population. Dear representatives of the banking sector, I kindly invite you to consider the issues addressed above more as an appeal to your rational judgement than to your emotions. The Bank of Albania will not, under no circumstances, take measures that would jeopardise the soundness of your financial positions or undermine the financial stability interests of Albania in the long term. That said, while safeguarding financial stability, I believe it is appropriate to engage in an open and transparent dialogue aimed at rethinking our approach to lending in the agricultural sector, in line with the long-term interests of the social and economic development of Albania.

The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 10 July 2025 by Vasileios Madouros PDF full te t (8kb) | 4 pages Good afternoon Chair and Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting us to appear before the Committee today. I am joined by my colleagues Martin O'Brien, Head of our Irish Economic Analysis Division and Thomas Conefrey, Deputy Head in the same Division. We very much welcome the opportunity to engage with you on the outlook for the economy and the public finances. In my opening statement, I will cover briefly our latest assessment of the economic outlook, as outlined in our June Quarterly Bulletin , as well as our latest economic advice to the Government, as outlined in the Governor's pre-Budget letter (PDF 3.04MB) , published last week. The economic outlook Let me start with the global conte t, because the key factors shaping the domestic outlook stem from developments abroad, but with important implications for Ireland. Since the start of the year, we have seen a material shift in trade policy, with rising tariffs between the US and its trading partners, as well as a sharp increase in policy uncertainty. In light of these developments, the global growth outlook has weakened. Short-term forecasts for world trade and economic activity have been revised downwards. And uncertainty around these forecasts is particularly elevated, given the range of potential outcomes around trade policy. The openness of the Irish economy and the prominent role that FDI and multinational firms play domestically mean that Ireland is particularly e posed to changes in the global economic outlook as well as shifts in trade policy, and broader economic policy, in the US. Given uncertainty over the future direction of US trade policy, our June Quarterly Bulletin presented projections for the economy under a baseline and a more adverse scenario. These were based on different assumptions around the level and coverage of tariffs, the level and persistence of uncertainty and the future path of financing conditions. In the baseline scenario, we e pected Modified Domestic Demand to grow by 2.0 per cent in 2025 and by 2.1 per cent per annum on average in 2026 and 2027. This is a downward revision to the growth outlook relative to our previous projections – but the central outlook is still consistent with a full-employment economy. The adverse scenario assumed persistently higher and broader tariffs, including due to retaliation from the EU. It also assumed that policy uncertainty would remain higher for longer and that financing conditions would be tighter. In this scenario, annual average MDD growth would almost halve compared to the baseline, illustrating the sensitivity of economic activity to an escalation of trade tensions. The trade-offs facing the public finances The economy and public finances are entering this period of heightened uncertainty from a strong position. But there are also underlying vulnerabilities that need to be managed carefully. The e ceptional growth in corporation ta receipts since 2015 and the strong pace of economic e pansion in recent years have resulted in a marked increase in government revenues. As a result, even with the substantial rise in government spending and some ta cuts, the headline budget balance has run substantial surpluses in recent years. However, e ternal developments mean that this benign combination of factors, namely, a rapidly growing economy and e ceptional corporate ta receipts, could be at risk in the coming years. In particular, risks to the fiscal position from lower corporate ta es and other MNE-dependent ta es have increased given recent international developments. And, e cluding estimated \"e cess\" corporation ta (and the impact of the Apple State Aid case), the budget balance has been in a persistent deficit position for 17 consecutive years. At the same time, in the current juncture, an important public policy priority is the need for higher investment, both to address infrastructure deficits and to support the transition to net zero. Indeed, these infrastructure deficits have become an increasingly significant factor constraining the supply side of the economy. Addressing infrastructure deficits will not only help meet important societal and economic needs today, but also enable our economy to remain competitive amid a shifting geopolitical landscape. Finally, looking further into the future, there are known future funding needs that the State needs to prepare for today. Given demographic trends, Ireland is e pected to see the largest increase in age-related spending, on areas such as pensions, healthcare and long-term care, amongst the EU by 2050. And we know already that the Future Ireland Fund, the establishment of which has been a very positive public policy intervention, will not be sufficient, on its own, to finance the higher level of public e penditure that will be required to meet the needs of an older population. Overall, the current environment presents important trade-offs for fiscal policy. Between investing in infrastructure, but not adding e cessively to demand in a capacity-constrained economy. Between addressing the funding needs of today, but also preparing for the funding needs of the future. Managing those trade-offs While undoubtedly this presents a difficult balancing act, careful management of the public finances can contribute to achieving these multiple aims. So let me finish off by summarising our economic policy advice outlined in the Governor's pre-budget letter, in light of those trade-offs. I will focus on three areas in particular. First, it is important that the Government commits, and adheres to, a credible fiscal anchor that results in sustainable increases in net government e penditure over time. In the current conte t of the economy operating at capacity, it is important, from a macro-stabilisation perspective, that the overall fiscal policy stance does not add e cessively to demand. Second, within that overall fiscal envelope, the public finances need to prioritise investment. Sustainably achieving the necessary rise in public investment requires creating sufficient economic and fiscal space, through offsetting choices in terms of current spending or ta ation. Beyond demand management considerations, broadening the ta base is also important for addressing future funding needs and mitigating the reliance of the public finances on corporate ta receipts. Third, public investment alone will not be sufficient to address the economy's infrastructure gaps. Measures that reduce delays, and, therefore, the ultimate costs, in the planning and building of infrastructure are needed to help ensure that the benefits of public investment for long-term growth are realised fully. Measures that incentivise scale and investment in new machinery, equipment and technologies in the construction sector can also help enhance productivity and enable more sustainable delivery of housing and infrastructure. These structural policies can have an outsized impact on strengthening the supply side of the economy, complementing, and adding to the effectiveness of, additional public investment in infrastructure. Thank you for your attention and we look forward to your questions.

The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 10 July 2025 by Eddie Yue PDF full te t (10kb) | 3 pages Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. It is an honour to join you today as we celebrate the 8th anniversary of the Bond Connect. The theme today, \"Unlocking Value through China's Resilience,\" could not be more timely. The global capital markets are undergoing profound transformation, driven by a host of factors including increasing trade tensions, geopolitical and economic shifts, and changing investment appetite and patterns. These changes are reshaping the way capital flows across the world, creating both new opportunities and challenges for market participants. Now, let me first share some observations about the macro trends. Macro trends: The first trend is global diversification. Global capital markets have been on a roller-coaster driven by shifting policies and economic uncertainties. In light of these unpredictable swings, diversification stands out as the most essential investment strategy. Indeed we are now in a world of unprecedented choice and many more institutional investors are looking to further diversifying their portfolios. The strong investor response to the Hong Kong Government's recent issuance of HK$27 billion in green and infrastructure bonds is telling of the diversifying trend. This multi-currency issuance attracted participation from a wide spectrum of investors from more than 30 markets across Asia, Europe, Middle East, and the Americas, with total order at about 9 times of the issuance size. In particular, the 30-year HKD government bond was offered for the first time, further e tending the HKD yield curve. The 20-year and 30-year RMB government bonds, which were first introduced last year, also received overwhelming support, doubling in issuance size from last year. Against this backdrop of global trend for diversification, China's bond assets have emerged as a particularly compelling choice. First, China's bond market is the second largest in the world. Chinese bonds have the market depth and liquidity to become an increasingly important asset class among global investors. Secondly, China has a relatively low debt level, with the general government debt-to-GDP ratio at around 84%, which is much lower than some major advanced economies. 1 Thirdly, the low correlation between China's onshore market and major global markets, at just 0.1 over the past 10 years, makes China bonds a very good diversifier. 2 Fourthly, the risk-adjusted return of China bonds is relatively attractive. Onshore RMB bonds had an annualised volatility of around 1.3% over the past year, significantly lower than the volatility in other advanced markets during the same period. 3 This combination of features of China's bond market as an attractive asset class for global investors seeking high-quality investments. In fact, according to a recent survey on central banks, over 30% of the respondents e pect to increase their RMB holdings in the next five years. The second trend is Mainland China's rapid wealth accumulation, particularly in institutional capital, which is creating new opportunities for their outbound investment. For e ample, China's national pension reserve fund grew to around USD 400 billion by the end of 2023. 4 Recent policy discussion also reaffirms that China encourages the national pension fund to cooperate with high-quality overseas investment managers to optimise its investment approach. 5 The new private pension scheme has already attracted over 60 million participants since its inception in 2022, with this rapidly growing pool of capital projected to reach nearly USD 1 trillion by 2030. 6 As Mainland institutional investors increasingly seek to diversify their portfolios and e pand overseas asset allocation, there is significant potential for future growth in the Southbound Bond Connect, through Hong Kong's platform to invest overseas. These two-way trends -- global investors' growing interest in RMB-denominated bonds and Mainland investors' e panding overseas allocations -- underscore the critical role of the Bond Connect as a gateway to facilitate cross-border capital flows between the Mainland and global financial markets. In a rapidly changing global financial landscape, the ability to adapt and innovate is key. Bond Connect e emplifies the power of collaboration and innovation in addressing the changing needs of investors, as it continues to evolve over the years. Policy work: In the past year, we have been working closely with relevant Mainland authorities, especially with the People's Bank of China, to step up efforts to enhance the Bond Connect and its ecosystem. I wish to take the opportunity to make the following three announcements: First, under the Northbound channel, investors can already use Bond Connect bonds as collateral for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)'s RMB Liquidity Facility, margin collateral for OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited (OTCC) derivative transactions, and for conducting offshore RMB bond repurchase (repo) transactions. We are e panding the offshore RMB repo business to also support re-hypothecation and cross-currency repo, and the CMU OmniClear will enhance the operational arrangements accordingly. These enhancements will be implemented in late August 2025. Secondly, the Southbound Bond Connect investor scope is e panded to include securities firms, fund companies, insurance companies and wealth management companies, formally effective from today. This will open up more channels to meet the growing demand from Mainland investors, addressing their needs for diversified asset allocation. It will also bolster the development of Hong Kong's bond market by widening the investor base and enhancing market liquidity, hence increasing Hong Kong's attractiveness to bond issuers and global investors. Thirdly, further to the announcement in May 2025, 30-year interest rate swaps (IRS) contracts have already gone live early last week (on 30 June) under the Swap Connect, and IRS contracts using the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) as reference rate will be launched in the coming months. Besides, we have been working on strengthening Hong Kong's financial infrastructure to support greater efficiency in the Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese bond markets. For e ample, the recent signing of a MoU between CMU OmniClear and LCH could facilitate the wider use of CNH bonds as collateral in the international market. This highlights the unparalleled role of Hong Kong's infrastructure in supporting investment in CNH-denominated debt securities by investors from all over the world. Looking ahead: As investors navigate geopolitical changes and search for greater diversification, the Bond Connect will continue to serve as a key platform connecting China's bond market with the world. The HKMA will work closely with stakeholders to ensure that the platform will meet these changing needs -- by enhancing market liquidity (such as cross-border repo in the pipeline), strengthening risk management (with offshore CMOF bond futures under preparation), and further broadening the investment channels. The continuous development of Bond Connect will not only deepen market integration but also reinforce Hong Kong's unique role as a gateway between China and the international financial market.

Central bank speech | 10 July 2025 by Andrew Hauser PDF full te t (573kb) | 18 pages Introduction It is a great honour to address you on the 100th anniversary of the Economics Society of Australia. It's an honour because, over that past century, Australian thinkers have helped develop some of the most important building blocks in open economy macroeconomics – the branch of economics that seeks to understand how the global trading economy works. Those were significant – sometimes world-leading – intellectual achievements. But they were more than just that. Because they also shaped the policies and institutions that helped Australia navigate the global economy of that period so successfully, delivering wealth and stability for its citizens. Indeed Australian macroeconomic research has pulled that trick off twice. First, powering the ideas that lifted the country out of the Great Depression to flourish after the Second World War. And, second, helping to design a reform program that rescued the country from the slump of the 1970s, and led to more than a quarter century of recession-free growth. Two Golden Ages, marshalling thought into action. But to thrive in the next 100 years, Australia's researchers will need to go for the hat-trick.

      "content": "Andrew Bailey: The meaning of reserve currency Panel remarks by Mr Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Andrew Crockett Memorial Lecture, on the occasion of the Bank for International Settlement's Annual General Meeting, Basel, 29 June 2025. The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 10 July 2025 by Andrew Bailey PDF full te t (6kb) | 3 pages It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to make some remarks this afternoon. This is not just to be able to follow a fascinating and timely lecture, but also because I worked for Andrew Crockett at the Bank of England nearly 40 years ago. Andrew was inspiring to work for, one of the deepest thinkers about international economic policy and central banking. He also had a quite incautious side too. He was a practitioner of one of his favourite phrases – \"if you have never missed a plane, you obviously arrive at airports too early\". Andrew was also the creator of the Financial Stability Forum, and its first chair. I want to spend my time developing a theme that has run though Maury's lecture, namely what has been the meaning of the term reserve currency, and what does it mean today. My conclusion is that it is best to think of the term as one that has evolved with the times, and continues to do so. Thinking of it as a constant term does not help to understand its meaning. I will start with the nineteenth century meaning of the term. The monetary regime was the classical gold standard, and convertibility of domestic currency into gold at a fi ed price was the nominal anchor of the system. The term reserve therefore referred to the gold reserves that were held to enable convertibility and the promise thereof. The nineteenth century Bank of England spent time managing that reserve balance to create confidence in the promise of convertibility. Today, our banknotes still carry the words \"I promise to pay the bearer on demand, the sum of\". Nowadays, it means that someone can have another banknote, but under the gold standard it meant much more. This system did not put as much emphasis on financial stability, with the consequence that when crises occurred (as they did in that time), they were managed with a certain degree of adhocery. Hence, Walter Bagehot wrote his famous critique of the Bank. There was rather more to the concept of reserve currency in this period. Sterling was the premier currency of international trade, built on trade with the British Empire, but e tending further over time to the countries of the so-called Sterling Area. It is one of the questions in central bank Trivial Pursuit to name countries in the Sterling Area. The collapse of this system between the wars led to the Bretton Woods system coming into e istence and its heyday once full convertibility was restored. This system had the joint dollar-gold anchor in the form of a fi ed dollar-gold rate and pegging of the major currencies. The consequence was a substantial growth of official dollar reserves, and the further emergence thus of the dollar as the reserve currency. The system therefore had a joint anchor. Because Bretton Woods solved the so-called Trilemma by restricting capital flows, the threat of countries e hausting reserves was limited, but not sufficiently so to prevent difficult devaluations at times. Moreover, I tend to think of the Triffin Dilemma as posing the question – what if the bluff of the dollar-gold tie had been called, and what would be the consequence? From the early 1970s that system broke down. Countries moved to free float, with periodic attempts at management, and a lifting of restrictions on capital controls. Alongside this was the emergence of the domestic anchor of monetary policy, usually an inflation target. The dollar had become the predominant currency of international trade and payments. The role and nature of reserves had changed. No longer were they a nineteenth century description of the central bank's balance sheet and its liquidity under the classical gold standard. Rather, they became a description of so-called official reserves typically, but not always, held by governments, though often managed by central banks. Their role was different, reflecting the changes to the solution of the Trilemma. As foreign e change intervention to influence e change rates came to an end, the role of reserves in many countries was to act as a bulwark against pressures from capital flows, as seen in the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. A few numbers help here. The stock of F reserves relative to global GDP increased from 3% to 11% between 1976 and last year. During that period, foreign currency reserves as a proportion of global reserve assets including gold increased from 50% to 90%, while the dollar's share of foreign currency reserves declined from 80% to 57%. I take four points from these figures: the total stock of F reserves has increased; the share of gold fell; the dollar's share fell as it moved from being the anchor currency to the largest currency; and the evidence further supports the view that the meaning of the term reserve currency has changed over time. Today, with domestic monetary anchors, financial stability has become the focus of international co-ordination, the opposite of the gold standard arrangements. The meaning of reserve currency has changed again as a consequence. I would point to two important features of today's system. First, the concept of reserve currency has a lot more to do with the supply and denomination of safe assets which act as security in the financial system, and are increasingly at the heart of it. This version of the concept of reserve currency has as much to do with the role of US Treasuries as a safe asset, that is present not just in official reserves but also to provide security and collateral in financial markets. Second, these arrangements are backed up by the provision of contingent liquidity insurance in the form of central bank swaps and a repo facility. These arrangements underpin the role and primacy of the reserve currency. I will end with two points which strike me as unfinished or emerging. First, at least for the large economies, it could be asked today, what is the point of official reserves? My view is that today their use is more to do with preserving financial stability in the event of stress. They may be needed to support financial system liquidity in situations of e treme stress. My second point, as BIS colleagues have emphasised, is that we need to watch carefully the evolution of payments forms and whether innovation here introduces fragility into what I would call the \"money system\". If, for instance, stablecoins emerge as a new form of money, we have to decide how to ensure the singleness of money and therefore trust in money in this world, and what role the notion of reserve currency should play here. To finish, thank you Maury for such a stimulating lecture. You pushed me to think further about the meaning of reserve currency. The conclusion I draw was that we need to emphasise more its adaptable nature, but thereby be very clear what it means in the world of today and tomorrow. Thank you.

One of the main challenges we are currently facing as policymakers is finding the right adjective to describe the kind of uncertainty we are dealing with: e treme, unprecedented, unpredictable? We are navigating a very comple policymaking environment characterised by a high degree of uncertainty. To begin with, let me e plain why uncertainty is currently so high. The US Economic Policy Uncertainty Inde shows that the degree of uncertainty surrounding economic policy in the United States is at e treme levels in general, and also in specific areas: monetary policy, fiscal policy, regulation, and trade policy. We are currently e periencing unprecedented levels of uncertainty in all of these areas. Trade is a clear e ample, but fiscal policy in the United States is similarly affected. The Congressional Budget Office projects, in the absence of new fiscal policies, persistent deficits of over 5% of GDP for the next decade and a debt-to-GDP ratio rising from 100% to 150%.

It is a great pleasure and honour for me to speak here today. I truly appreciate the warm hospitality of Eesti Pank. Since my arrival, I have spent an e citing weekend enjoying several concerts, a trip to the Estonian wilderness, and a walking tour of your beautiful Old Town. Ladies and gentlemen, Estonia and Germany are connected in surprising ways. For e ample, the esteemed Estonian economist Ragnar Nurkse, in whose honour this lecture series is being held, attended Tallinna Toomkool. The school was also formerly known as the Domschule zu Reval, and its lessons were held in German. Estonia and Germany have also shared a similar economic fate in recent years: Both countries' economies have largely stagnated since the outbreak of the COVID- 19 pandemic. Today, I want to share my thoughts on how the German economy reached its current state and how it could recover. I will structure my remarks around three key questions. First, what is the current state of the German economy, and what are the main drivers shaping the economic outlook?

The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 07 July 2025 by Christine Lagarde and Philip R Lane PDF full te t (18kb) | 7 pages Good afternoon, ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane and I welcome you to this press conference, on the occasion of the conclusion of the 2025 assessment of our monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council recently agreed on an updated monetary policy strategy statement. You can find this statement on our website, together with an e planatory overview note and the two occasional papers presenting the underlying analyses. I will start by putting this strategy assessment into the broader conte t. Philip Lane will then go through the updated strategy statement and e plain what has changed and why, as well as what has remained unchanged. Following the strategy review we carried out in 2020-21, the Governing Council committed to \"assess periodically the appropriateness of its monetary policy strategy, with the next assessment e pected in 2025\". Such regular assessments ensure that our framework, toolkit and approach remain fit for purpose in a changing world. And the world has changed significantly over the last four years. Some of the issues we were most concerned about back in 2021 – including inflation being too low for too long – have taken a rather different turn. Not only did we see inflation surge, but some fundamental structural features of our economy and the inflation environment are changing: geopolitics, digitalisation, the increasing use of artificial intelligence, demographics, the threat to environmental sustainability and the evolution of the international financial system. All of those suggest that the environment in which we operate will remain highly uncertain and potentially more volatile. This will make it more challenging to conduct our monetary policy and fulfil our mandate to keep prices stable. During the strategy assessment, we asked: what do these changes mean for the way we assess the economy, conduct our policy, use our toolkit, take our decisions and communicate them? In seeking to answer this question, our mindset was forward-looking. On the whole, we concluded that our monetary policy strategy remains well suited to addressing the challenges that lie ahead. But our strategy also needs to be updated and adjusted in certain areas, so that the ECB can remain fit for purpose in the years to come. The next assessment is e pected in 2030. With our updated strategy statement, we are taking a comprehensive perspective on the challenges facing our monetary policy, so that the ECB can remain an anchor of stability in this more uncertain world. This is our core message to the euro area citizens we serve: the new environment gives many reasons to worry, but one thing they do not need to worry about is our commitment to price stability. The ECB is committed to its mandate and will keep itself and its tools updated to be able to respond to new challenges. Let me conclude by thanking, on behalf of the Governing Council, all the colleagues across the Eurosystem who have contributed to this assessment in a great team effort. I now hand over to our Chief Economist Philip Lane and, following his remarks, we will be ready to take your questions. * * * Philip R. Lane: I'm going to focus on the 12 paragraphs of The ECB's monetary policy strategy statement . What's important is that behind these paragraphs is a lot of work. The base layer is the two occasional papers. I'm sure you've already read the 400 pages in those two occasional papers. There's a lot of rich new analysis of many dimensions in those two occasional papers. Then we have the overview note, which the Governing Council worked on collectively and which basically provides the elaboration behind these 12 paragraphs. And I would say that in these 12 paragraphs, in this review, we essentially tried to review the economic assessment: where are we and where are we likely to be? That was one of the two work streams. That essentially primarily shows up in paragraph 1. So paragraph 1, you might say, is one paragraph, but it's a very important paragraph because it essentially outlines the challenges that we may face. We had a similar paragraph last time, but last time the focus was essentially on a lot of factors that can give rise to a low-inflation world and a low interest rate world. Whereas the assessment this time of the Eurosystem staff behind this is that when we look where we are now in the structural changes facing the world economy, we have geopolitics, and a lot of this is in the direction of rolling back globalisation. Last time we were looking at globalisation as a force which did contribute to low inflation before the pandemic. There are many dimensions to geopolitics, but we are of course already living it and this is something we do think is going to shape the next five years. We already mentioned digitalisation the last time, but this time we're calling that as a separate and important element: artificial intelligence. Because, of course, I think for a long time it has been understood that the world economy automates and digitalises. That's been around for a while. That's mature. What's not mature and where there's really a wide range of possibilities is: what does it mean as the business sector and the public sector incorporate artificial intelligence? I think we had already called out demography and the threat to environmental sustainability, and I think we're very correct to have done so five years ago. We've seen a lot on these fronts in these five years. Let me remind you: without immigration, the European labour force would be shrinking. So demography is not just a future trend, it's a year-by-year reality for us. And then this week, last week, this year, last year, all the time we see the impact of weather shocks and the impact of the green transition. By the way, investment in Europe in recent years would have been a lot lower without the green transition. It's the one solid driver of investment for many sectors at the moment. We call out all of these elements, but what's critical for our conclusion for monetary policy is that it creates uncertainty, it creates volatility, and we think what we may be faced with is larger deviations from our 2% target in both directions. So we have this two-sided risk assessment. And as I go through these paragraphs, essentially once we've identified this economic assessment, the natural question to ask is: how do we manage it? How does monetary policy manage this two-sided risk? And essentially in what follows, we will turn to the monetary policy implications. But the other thing to note about paragraph 1 is that there is a new sentence. That's the final sentence. It is that we don't live in a bubble. We don't say monetary policy is the only game in town. And we do highlight here that a more resilient financial architecture – supported by progress on the savings and investments union, the completion of banking union and the introduction of a digital euro – would also support the effectiveness of monetary policy in this evolving environment. So, in other words, all of these structural changes are much more easily handled if we have a more resilient euro, European and euro-denominated financial system. And I think that's also important and maybe helps you to understand why we as Board members, and more generally the Governing Council, spend a lot of time talking about these wider issues. It's not a distraction from monetary policy. It's an important underpinning for monetary policy. Paragraph 2 is unchanged because paragraph 2 is setting the legal conte t. We have a mandate given by the Treaty, and so to make the strategy statement self-contained, it's a reminder to you of the legal and Treaty constraints we live under. And that essentially remains the same as last time. The third paragraph, because remember in the European Treaty there's not a super detailed definition of price stability, so it's important and this is something that evolved over the years: that in terms of measurement, we're focused on the Harmonised Inde of Consumer Prices (HICP). And again, this is stable from last time. Last time we highlighted that we did think a reform of the HICP to include owner-occupied housing would be desirable. We continue to hold that view. But in the end it's for the European Statistical System to make progress on that. So what we say is that in the meantime we do take into account inflation measures that include estimates of the cost of owner-occupied housing. So, in other words, we create supplementary indicators. These are not official data, but we do take a look. And these would be relevant in scenarios where house prices were rising far more quickly or far more slowly than the overall inflation rate. By the way, this has not been particularly the issue in recent years. It would not have made a big difference in recent years, but of course in principle we could be in a situation in the future where it made a difference. Paragraph 4 is again largely stable from last time. It's e plaining why we target 2%, not zero, and that's a fairly mature topic: why you want to have a safety margin. We do, and I think correctly this time, in the final sentence of paragraph 4 include intersectoral adjustment. In the last five years we've seen this massive change between goods prices and services prices. And actually it turns out that that's a very important consideration. It's a lot easier to handle an under 2% inflation target than if you're trying to hit zero. Essentially if you're trying to hit zero and the price of energy compared with goods rose, implicitly you need to drive down the price of goods. And we know for many reasons that deflation, even at the sectoral level, is difficult. So having a 2% target is reinforced by including intersectoral adjustment in that list. So, paragraph 4 says you need a safety margin. Paragraph 5 says 2% is the best way to maintain price stability and that our commitment is symmetric. So what this symmetry means is that we consider negative and positive deviations from the target as equally undesirable. The last sentence, I think, has been critical in these years: having a clear target. You may have heard us all many times say 2%. It's not somewhere in the region of 2%. It's 2%. And having that clarity is very important for anchoring expectations, so I think it turned out that that choice we made to be precise about what our orientation is in the medium term is very important. Let me turn to a paragraph where I think there has been an important change, a sensible change – something that you might say sounds so sensible, why are you talking about it? But it's worth highlighting the update. Last time, in 2021, we felt we needed to point out that the symmetry of the target doesn't mean that how we set monetary policy looks identical whether we're above the target or below the target. And so we pointed out that if we have a lower bound issue, we need to be appropriately forceful or persistent. What have we learnt from these five years? That remains true for below-target inflation, but actually it's equally true for above-target inflation. And what we actually did was we had a phase of being forceful. So from July 2022 to September 2023, we hiked a lot. And then we went into a persistent phase. So from September 2023 to June 2024, we had 4%. The overview note goes into more detail about why you need the blend of forceful and persistent. But when we reviewed this, peers said these were important concepts in relation to the lower bound, but they're equally appropriate concepts in relation to being above target. It's not, of course, in relation to blips. What we talk about here is in response to large, sustained deviations. So you have to first of all make the call. What we see in front of us is something that's materially away from 2% and that would remain away from 2% unless we responded. And this is why we say \"appropriately forceful or persistent\", because what e actly is appropriate depends on whether you are dealing with an upside shock, a downside shock and a wider set of issues. So that, I think, is important. Let me come back to this issue that we have a symmetric commitment and we're two-sided, but the headache is different on both sides. On the downside, the lower bound is the main headache. On the upside – and this reflects so much of the last number of years and reflects a lot of the work in the occasional papers – is possible non-linearities in price and wage-setting. What we learnt is that once inflation starts to build, it can take off and it can accelerate. You can get this non-linear dynamic. And that's why you need to be forceful on the upside. That's not really true for downside shocks. They tend not to accelerate, but downside shocks tend to get embedded because your ability to respond on monetary policy is different. Going back to this point that it's not about smoothing out every deviation from 2% and it's large, sustained deviations: this is very much in the spirit of the medium-term orientation. And that's paragraph 7. So paragraph 7 is stable. We already had a medium-term orientation, I think, throughout the whole history of the ECB. And I think that's been very wise. Our commitment, in line with the opening remarks from the President, is that people should be able to count on our commitment to price stability. If we see a deviation, we will bring it back to 2%. And that's our medium-term orientation. There's one enrichment here, which I think makes sense. People often ask: how long is the medium term? And I think a very important discipline on that is in the final sentence now: \"subject to maintaining anchored inflation expectations\". That really defines the medium term. As you know, in recent years we mapped that into \"we will make sure inflation returns to target in a timely manner\". You need to impose some discipline on yourself as opposed to saying the medium term is always just over the projection horizon. The medium term means not so long that the anchoring of expectations is put at risk. So again, I think that's always been true, but it's better to be e plicit about it. And maybe now, as journalists, if you ask Governing Council members in the future how long the medium term is, the medium term is how long it takes without putting into question the anchoring of expectations. Paragraph 8 is our toolbo paragraph. We already said in 2021 that our primary instrument is the set of ECB policy rates. I do wonder, for those of you who were involved in looking at the ECB in 2021, how many of you fully believed that as we moved away from the lower bound, we would stop quantitative easing (QE) and we would stop forward guidance? But that was in our strategy and that's what we did. These are tools that make sense at the lower bound. They are not tools from a stance point of view that have the same role away from the lower bound. So one basic message is: already in 2021 we told you a lot about how the toolbo works, but we did obviously come back and look at this. It's an important topic. Let me highlight a couple of revisions here, or amplifications. One is that I think we are more articulate now about when these tools come into play. One is to steer the monetary policy stance when the rates are close to the lower bound. That's what we said last time. That's definitely a big category. But the second category is \"or to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission\". March 2020 is one e ample. When the world's financial market was hit by the pandemic shock, central banks in general did a lot of asset purchasing, refinancing operations and other elements to stabilise the transmission of monetary policy. So again, what I would say is either it's because we're near the lower bound or there's some big drama causing an interruption to the transmission of monetary policy. But otherwise these instruments remain in the toolbo . They're available, but they're not used on a continuous basis. And so we list out these tools just as a reminder. Longer-term refinancing and asset purchases: those two would possibly be used either way. For the stance or for smoothing the transmission of policy. Whereas of course negative rates and forward guidance are more particular to the lower bound. So there is a differentiation within that category. We also said last time that we will respond fle ibly to new challenges as they arise and we can consider new instruments. And of course we told you that we considered new instruments and we actually did it, because we did introduce the Transmission Protection Instrument in 2022. And then the last sentence is important because this is where a lot of the discussion in the last year has been. It is to look back at these this set of instruments and on a forward basis say, in the future, if we ever came to these situations, how would we use these instruments? So we say in this important sentence: the choice of which one we use or which combination we use, the design – because on day zero, we usually have a press release or a legal act saying here's the design of our instrument – and the implementation. So in other words, month by month, how we adjust it and how we bring it to an end in terms of e it. All of these, number one, will enable an agile response to new shocks. So let's not get locked into rigid programmes that would inhibit our ability to respond to new shocks. They will reflect the intended purpose. So there can be differences between a stance-orientated intervention and a transmission-smoothing-type intervention. And then, of course, all of these will be subject to a comprehensive proportionality assessment. So in considering the choice of tools, the design and the implementation, we need the checklist of whether this is proportional to the challenge we face. So that's, as I say, the toolbo . Then paragraph 9 is e plaining how we make decisions. A lot of this is similar to last time. Last time we basically had to tell you that we've decided, rather than having a two-pillar strategy where we have an economic pillar and a monetary pillar, we make an integrated assessment. And in that integrated assessment, for e ample, we take into account macro-financial linkages, financial stability and so on. So a lot of that remains, but maybe you might find this new sentence interesting. The second sentence is that in how we make decisions, we take into account not only the most likely path for inflation in the economy, i.e. in a projection for the baseline, we don't just look at the baseline, but also the surrounding risks and uncertainty. How do we do that? Including through the appropriate use of scenario and sensitivity analysis. This is something we have done forever, but it's probably true that it's not always visible in how we communicate. And also internally, of course, the science of how you should do scenarios and the science of how you should make sure your decisions are robust is always evolving. So we do want to make this clear. And in fairness for you and for others watching us, you can say \"I think I understand this decision in the conte t of the baseline, but I have a natural question: is it also robust to the risk assessment of the ECB?\" And I think that will be a step forward in the conversation about monetary policy. By the way, this is already reflected, importantly, because, as you may have noticed, what we've said in the last couple of years is that we make our decisions not only based on the inflation outlook, but also in relation to underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission. Because those two dimensions capture a lot of risk. Underlying inflation captured a lot of risk when we were bringing inflation down from 10% to 2%. The strength of monetary transmission captured a lot of risk as we moved interest rates, first of all, steeply upwards and then as we've been reversing. So the logic behind the three-pronged reaction function that we've been using reflects these principles. Paragraph 10 reaffirms, and I think everything we've learnt from the last four years validates the assessment that, in terms of price stability, climate change has profound implications in terms of the structure of the economy, the rise and fall of particular sectors, the cycle, including through the impact of weather shocks, and also in terms of how the financial system is adjusting. This is also a policy priority for the European Union and a global challenge. So we are committed to ensuring the Eurosystem fully takes into account, in line with the EU's goals and objectives, the implications of climate change and nature degradation for monetary policy and central banking. We added – because we've already added it elsewhere – \"and nature degradation\" because essentially it's the same headache. And in terms of our economic analysis, you've also seen it in our publications. The same underlying failure to incorporate the global public good of a sustainable environment permeates that. Paragraph 11 reaffirms that clear communication is centre stage of our policymaking. We want effective communication at all levels. And this is why we think the layered and visualised approach to monetary policy communication is essential. Also, we want to adapt in this rapidly changing communication landscape. There's more on that in the overview note. And, as you know, the ECB has been rolling out new types of communication, including Espresso Economics on YouTube in recent times. And then maybe in line with the idea that it's good housekeeping to have a regular calendar-based commitment, the next assessment of the appropriateness of the strategy will be in 2030.

It is a great pleasure to host this conference and to welcome so many of you here today, colleagues, partners, and stakeholders, to share perspectives on the evolving risks that climate change poses to the financial sector. Climate agenda competing for attention in a comple global risk environment Let me begin by acknowledging the broader conte t in which we meet. The global economy and financial system face multiple challenges and high uncertainty, stemming from geopolitical tensions and trade fragmentation to cyber risks and structural shifts. These pressing concerns rightly command our full attention. But for that reason, they also risk overshadowing challenges such as climate change which are perceived as longer-term. This happens at a time when climate policies face stronger headwinds in some parts of the world. This may slow the global energy transition and speed up climate change and the associated risks.

The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 07 July 2025 by Dr Kevin Greenidge PDF full te t (5kb) | 2 pages Good morning to all of you. It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the Courtney Blackman Grande Salle of the Central Bank of Barbados for the Fast Payments Systems Workshop for Caribbean Countries . We are truly honoured to host this meeting of the minds as we advance our domestic payments infrastructure to be more inclusive, efficient, and resilient. This workshop comes at a crucial juncture for the Central Bank of Barbados as we are onboarding a national instant payments system in Barbados, with the power to catalyse the payments landscape. Rolling out this national instant payment system will integrate our payments network; promote real-time settlement for retail, wholesale, e-government, and securities payments; empower micro and small businesses; support greater system transparency and security, standardisation, and interoperability; and lower transaction and operating costs, as well as settlement times, all while promoting financial inclusion. Across the globe, central banks are leading the most successful implementations of faster payment systems. These efforts are ensuring that national payments systems are safe, efficient, and accessible to all-especially the underserved and unbanked. As a central bank, we have the responsibility to provide this instant payment system as a public good, which will not only keep pace with innovation, but will also benefit our citizens, our financial sector, the economy as a whole, and our future. As we at the Central Bank of Barbados are embarking on this journey, we are placing strong emphasis on meeting international standards, while achieving interoperability, built on a solid foundation of robust governance, and strong cybersecurity mechanisms. We are eager to learn from our regional partners' e periences and align ourselves with global best practices to shape an instant payments ecosystem that works for our unique conte t. The workshop agenda over the next two days is both rich and relevant, allowing us to dive deep into the world of Instant Payment Systems. We will e amine design principles, governance models, implementation strategies, and operational challenges. We will also explore the integration of overlay services, discuss cybersecurity risks, and consider the potential for cross-border applications. Importantly, we will also hear directly from central banks that have walked this path and have lessons to share with us. We at the Central Bank of Barbados now have an incredible opportunity before us; to learn from global experts, like our partners joining us from the World Bank and the National Bank of Serbia, e amine the e periences of other jurisdictions, and explore just what it takes to successfully implement a faster payments network in Barbados. This workshop is not only timely-it is imperative. We now e ist in a world where consumers and businesses e pect instantaneous results in every aspect of their digital lives; payments cannot lag behind. Faster payments are no longer a lu ury or a future possibility-they are the new standard. So, I encourage everyone here to contribute actively to the discussions-to ask the tough questions, and to share your own insights and guidance. Let this be a collaborative space where we not only build knowledge, but build momentum as we continue the rollout of our national instant payments system. I want to e press my sincerest gratitude to our partners at the World Bank, whose support and keen technical e pertise have been invaluable to the progress of this payments initiative thus far. I also acknowledge and thank my fellow regional central bank governors for their leadership, commitment, and willing collaboration as we move forward in this space. As we embark on these two days of discussion and discovery, let us remember that faster payments are not just about technology, they are about creating systems that serve people better. They are about making our financial systems and economies more agile, our businesses more competitive, and our societies more inclusive, and our ultimate aim is to implement faster payments systems for all Caribbean countries. Let us lead this transformation together-with purpose, with partnership, and with the public good at heart. Thank you, and I look forward to the vibrant e change of ideas that lies ahead.

The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 07 July 2025 by Hajime Takata PDF full te t (868kb) | 31 pages I. Economic Activity and Prices I will begin by talking about developments in economic activity and prices. Overseas economies have grown moderately on the whole, although some weakness has been seen in part, reflecting trade and other policies in each jurisdiction. In the April 2025 World Economic Outlook (WEO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that the global economy will be heavily affected by U.S. tariff policy, while also highlighting further downside risk (Chart 1). However, looking at hard data, recent economic indicators suggest that the U.S. economy has grown moderately, despite concerns about the impact of tariff policy. While the Federal Reserve has kept its policy interest rate unchanged since the January 2025 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, some market participants e pect it to start cutting the policy rate again (Chart 2). As for the outlook, I am of the view that a sharp economic slowdown triggered by credit contraction, which was common during past economic downturns, is unlikely, owing to the sound balance sheets of households, firms, and financial institutions, among other factors. Instead of a serious recession, I have been e pecting the U.S. economy to grow only at a slower pace than its potential growth rate, mainly affected by a deterioration in consumer sentiment. Still, it is necessary to bear in mind that such an economic slowdown depends on the policies of the U.S. administration, and hence there are e tremely high uncertainties, both upside and downside. Even if the economy remains robust at the moment, the longer concerns about tariffs remain, the greater the downward pressure on economic activity could become, due to heightened uncertainty, and thus it is necessary to carefully e amine the situation from a long-term perspective. Meanwhile, as I will elaborate later,since it took office, the new U.S. administration has given priority to policies, such as tariffs, that have a negative impact on economic growth. If it were to pursue policies that have a positive impact on economic growth, such as reducing domestic ta es, the growth rate of the U.S. economy could be higher than e pected. With regard to overseas economies, Europe, the United States, and China and other emerging economies have all leaned toward accommodative policies on both the fiscal and monetary fronts. With the same policy direction adopted around the world, attention is also warranted on the possibility that this could, in combination, e ert greater-than-e pected upward pressure on economic activity and prices.

Central bank speech | 07 July 2025 by Anna Seim PDF full te t (397kb) | 8 pages Thank you for inviting me to speak today. While it is widely recognised that effective communication is a key part of monetary policy, communication strategies differ greatly across central banks. This is likely due to differences in institutional features that influence the possibilities and constraints that we face. Since adopting a regime of fle ible inflation targeting in 1995, the Riksbank has chosen a path of high transparency. One reason for this is the fact that we are highly independent, and with that independence comes a need for accountability that is facilitated by transparency. A second rationale is that transparency can make monetary policy more effective if we succeed in managing the expectations of companies, households and markets. To this end, we aim to convey the Executive Board's reaction function by publishing (i) a policy rate forecast (since 2007), (ii) alternative scenarios capturing perceived risks and how monetary policy will respond to different developments, and (iii) attributed minutes shortly after each policy decision. In my remarks today, I will briefly comment on our policy rate path but focus on our work with alternative scenarios in the Monetary Policy Report.

This moment comes at a time when the world faces profound and interconnected challenges related to environment and social wellbeing. According to the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) estimates, more than USD 4.2 trillion of financial assets could be at risk globally if the current climate-related impact trends continue. Based on the World Bank estimates, climate change could push an additional 130 million of the world population towards poverty unless decisive action is taken. In the Sri Lankan conte t, it is estimated that USD 10.85 billion is required for implementing the NDC's until 2030. As you all may agree, the e treme weather events we have witnessed are no longer anomalies; they are signs of a shifting climate that will increasingly impact our agriculture, energy security, infrastructure, and livelihoods hence sustainable finance is no longer optional. It is an economic, social, and environmental imperative globally and here in Sri Lanka. It was with this global reality in mind that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka launched its first Sustainable Finance Roadmap in 2019. That initiative set the foundation for integrating sustainability into our financial system, building awareness, and piloting green finance products. Today, as we launch the Sustainable Finance Roadmap 2.0, we are reaffirming and strengthening that commitment. First of all, I would like to e tend my gratitude to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), for the technical guidance and the European Union for collaborating with IFC for funding the project under the Accelerating Climate-Smart and Inclusive Infrastructure in South Asia (EU-ACSIIS) program which was a timely intervention as we completed five years since the launching of the first roadmap. I congratulate the project team and make this a point to thank all the stakeholders who engaged in the project and provided their valuable input and e pert knowledge in developing a well-balanced Roadmap. If I give you an essence of the conte t in which the Central Bank started this journey in 2016 with the joining of SBFN, the landscape for sustainable financing was more focused on environmental aspect of sustainability. However, over the years, closer to a decade, many dimensions related to sustainable development have gained momentum. As climate risk emerged as one of the major deterrents against financial stability it is the responsibility of the Central Bank to take initiatives to green the financial system in maintaining both price stability and financial stability as per the mandate vested upon CBSL. Climate change or the impact of climate events on the economy could be transformed into the financial sector in two ways. Supply side disruptions could trigger inflationary pressure weakening price stability while building up of non-performing portfolios following a catastrophe which could take a toll on financial system stability through a credit crisis. With the enactment of the new CBSL Act, Inclusiveness also comes under the duties of CBSL where we have strategized how financial inclusion could be achieved. Climate-related events are becoming more common, which raises concerns over financial institutions' ability to manage their risks and to continue to provide financial services in certain segments and geographies. Financial authorities are taking steps to integrate climate risk in their financial stability assessments. For e ample, Climate Scenario Analysis, Climate Stress Testing and Value chain analysis in relation to Green House Gas (GHG) emissions are carried out by the financial regulators and financial institutions in the global conte t. On the other hand, decarbonization efforts have reached new heights with tightened regulations especially in the European region which is challenging for the local industries catering to such markets. Simultaneously, reporting and disclosure requirements are getting streamlined globally with the introduction of accounting standards (S1 and S2) and other integrated reporting initiatives. National level commitments including NDCs, National Adaptation Plan and Net Zero Plan were revisited, and ambitious targets have been set. In this backdrop, the Central Bank policy interventions are necessary to ensure resilience while uplifting the inclusiveness among society for achieving greater prosperity. Particularly, we have incorporated the social aspect of sustainability into the Roadmap 2.0 as the New CBSL Act recognised inclusiveness as a duty of the Central Bank. Further, the Roadmap 2.0 has given more emphasis to the internal risk management frameworks in addressing climate challenges in the financial sector, while focusing on green initiatives. As you all know, the past few years have been a challenging period not only for the financial sector but for the whole economy. We have made considerable progress in terms of restoring stability, however the future challenges are not to be undermined. I believe Sustainable Finance Roadmap 2.0 is one such policy initiative that will guide us towards how we, particularly as the financial sector, should strategize in terms of environmental and social challenges that may arise due to potential climate events. In terms of the social aspect of sustainability the Roadmap 2.0 will serve for the broader theme of social justice with special emphasis on MSME's, vulnerable groups and gender equality. National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) Phase II will also be implemented as part of the Roadmap which is e pected to promote Inclusive Green Financing (IGF). We have challenges to overcome especially with inter institutional coordination and alignment with a national strategy in climate financing. More emphasis on adaptation financing remains to be addressed while different avenues to facilitate blended financing where the financial institutions can collaborate with the State need to be revisited. While new challenges will emerge with the evolution of the subject area, implementation of the actions laid down in Roadmap 2.0 is very important as it will strengthen the foundation of the financial sector to gain more resilience against climate risks while uplifting financial inclusion among society. We have maintained the momentum to be categorised as an advancing member country in terms of sustainable finance framework development and implementation in line with international trends and good practices as per the 2024 SBFN Global Brief. Successful implementation of RM 2.0 will position Sri Lanka at the forefront of the sustainable financing leadership in the region. At the launching of Roadmap 2.0 my request to all the stakeholders who have validated this document is to e tend your fullest cooperation in achieving the targets set in a timely manner and contributing to the area of sustainability both individually and collectively, understanding its criticality as a nation in driving the mandate on climate combating and social inclusiveness. I hope you will e tend your fullest cooperation and continue to engage with the Central Bank through the Stakeholder Committee and the Working groups to be formed in near future. With that I will conclude my address, wishing you all the very best for your commitments and endeavours in this area in the future. Thank you!

The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 07 July 2025 by Tuomas Välimäki PDF full te t (5kb) | 3 pages Dear friends, dear colleagues, I start with two pledges. First, this will be my final intervention today, and second, I'll be brief. Some of you know that we were supposed to hear an e cellent dinner speech by Francesco Papadia, my dear friend and co-author. Unfortunately, he couldn't join us today here in Helsinki after all, but I will hint on what his messages to us would have been. Francesco wanted to provide us with the big picture, by tackling the rise and fall of central bank balance sheet management indicating that the origin and the responsibility of sovereign spreads must be found in Rome, Paris, Helsinki and other Member State capitals rather than in Frankfurt. In his draft speech, Francesco concluded that managing the central bank's balance sheet has proven to be a useful tool in times of market stress and at the lower bound, though its effectiveness in the latter case was limited, as seen in the prolonged failure to meet the inflation target. To his view, which I do share, this highlights the need for stronger preemptive measures to avoid reaching the lower bound, without raising the inflation target, while recognizing that policy trade-offs become more pronounced at very low rates. For now, interest rate adjustments suffice, but balance sheet tools should remain available also for future use. When that time comes, we'll benefit from the lessons and data gathered, likely leading to a more cautious and informed application. Having said this, I don't dare try to replace Francesco, but as we are here tonight at Suomen Pankki's Villa, well-fed, surrounded by some of the sharpest minds in monetary policy implementation and waiting for the dessert, let me share you a story that has absolutely nothing to do with interest rates, liquidity tiers, or central bank balance sheets. It's a tale about monkeys. Five of them, to be precise. In a behavioral e periment, five monkeys were placed in a cage. A banana was hung enticingly from the ceiling, just out of reach, but with a ladder leading up to it. Naturally, one monkey climbed the ladder. But the moment he did so, all the monkeys get sprayed with cold water. Now, this was repeated with another brave monkey, with the same outcome. It didn't take long before they collectively realized that climbing the ladder equals group suffering. So they stop trying. Then the researchers, those mischievous minds, replaced one monkey with a newcomer. This fresh monkey, unaware of the watery consequences, made it for the banana... and was immediately attacked by the others before he even reached the first step of the ladder. No water was sprayed, the researchers had turned off the system, but naturally the enforcement continued. One by one, each of the original monkeys was replaced, and always the newcomer tried to go for the banana, and faced the consequences by being attacked by all other monkeys and learned the unpleasant lesson. This went on until none of the original water-sprayed monkeys remained. And yet, none of them went for the banana. Why? Because, in their silent consensus, they knew that if one of us tries to reach the banana, we will all attack him. But why: Well, that's just how it's always been done. Now, why am I telling you this at a dinner of a conference on monetary policy implementation? Because operational frameworks, like monkey ladders, carry the weight of precedent. Once built, they are carefully tended, tweaked, interpreted, and defended. Over time, features introduced in response to specific conditions can petrify into unquestioned norms. Liquidity instruments designed for crisis-fighting may persist long after the crisis has passed. Interest rate corridor widths, collateral eligibility rules, counterparty lists, these can all become ladders no one dares climb, even when the water has long stopped spraying. Of course, there is wisdom in continuity. We build on e perience. We don't reinvent the operational wheel with every policy cycle. But there's a fine line between honoring best practices and blindly preserving them. That is why gatherings like this, conferences that bring together practitioners, policymakers, and academics, are not just useful; they are essential. They give us a chance to ask: Why do we do things the way we do? What assumptions underlie our tools? What elements of our framework are there because they work, and which are there simply because they've always been there? Together, we explore the structure of our monetary policy operating frameworks. Not just to preserve them, but to improve them. We challenge each other, share our e periences, and spot the ladders we've stopped climbing, not because they're dangerous, but because we've forgotten why we ever feared them. So, as we enjoy this evening, let's toast not only to the smooth functioning of our frameworks, but also to the courage to e amine them critically, and to the discussions that keep us from turning into monkeys in tailored suits. Thank you all for today. Now it's time for our final agenda item, the dessert.

The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 07 July 2025 by Zhu He in PDF full te t (12kb) | 5 pages Distinguished Party Secretary Chen Jining, Former PBOC Governor Zhou iaochuan, Mayor Gong Zheng, Deputy Director Wang Jiang, Governor Pan Gongsheng, Minister Li Yunze, Chairman Wu Qing, Vice Minister Hu Haifeng, and dear guests, Good morning! It's a great pleasure to join you at the Lujiazui Forum. I would like to take this opportunity to e change some ideas with you on firmly advancing in-depth reforms and high-level opening-up in the foreign e change sector, with a view to better supporting high-quality economic development. Since April, the international economic and trade order has faced severe disruptions, and global financial markets have e perienced significant volatility. Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, China has strengthened counter-cyclical adjustments to macroeconomic policies, effectively responding to e ternal shocks. As a result, the foreign e change market has remained generally stable despite the comple and challenging environment. Since the beginning of this year, the RMB e change rate has moved in both directions with enhanced fle ibility. The RMB e change rate has appreciated by 1.6 percent against the US dollar and remained generally stable against a basket of currencies. China's foreign trade has demonstrated strong resilience, with the current account surplus staying within a reasonable and balanced range. Cross-border investment has become more active, with net increase in domestic bonds holdings by overseas investors at a relatively high level, and foreign buying of domestic equities increasing recently. Looking ahead, China's foreign e change market remains well-positioned to maintain overall stability. First, China's economy is e pected to maintain its recovery and growth momentum. China is stepping up the implementation of more proactive and effective macroeconomic policies, placing greater strategic emphasis on e panding domestic demand and strengthening the domestic economic circulation, while also fostering and scaling up new quality productive forces. These efforts will strongly support steady and sound economic growth. Recently, multiple international organizations and investment banks have raised their growth forecasts for China in 2025. Second, the balance of payments will maintain a basic equilibrium. China remains unwavering in its commitment to opening-up, with strengthened policy measures to stabilize foreign trade and investment, and a steady e pansion of financial market access. These factors will help foster more balanced cross-border capital flows. Third, China's foreign e change market will become more resilient. Market participants have become more mature and rational, with the proportion of corporate foreign e change hedging and the share of RMB cross-border settlements in goods trade both rising to around 30 percent, significantly enhancing their ability to cope with e change rate fluctuations. In recent years, we have also accumulated rich e perience in managing various risks. Despite continued uncertainties and instabilities in the e ternal environment, we have both the capability and confidence to maintain the sound operation of the foreign e change market and keep the RMB e change rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level, thereby creating a favorable environment for high-quality economic development. Ladies and gentlemen, General Secretary i Jinping has emphasized the importance of staying committed to running our own affairs well and steadfastly e panding high-level opening-up, so as to counter the uncertainties of a rapidly changing e ternal environment with the certainties of high-quality development. We will strike a balance between development and security, continue to deepen reform and opening-up in the foreign e change sector, and promote the modernization of the foreign e change governance system and governance capacity. Efforts will be made to build a sound foreign e change management system featuring \"greater convenience, e panded opening-up, enhanced security, and upgraded intelligence\" . We will unswervingly pursue a path of financial development with Chinese characteristics, thus providing stronger foreign e change support for China's high-quality economic development. First, in terms of \"greater convenience\", we will continue to improve a foreign e change policy system that rewards integrity with greater access, and proactively enhance the quality and efficiency of foreign e change services for the real economy. We will step up reform and innovation in foreign e change management, and grant greater convenience to entities with strong records of compliance and integrity, thus further facilitating the cross-border trade, investment and financing. Firstly, we will focus on sci-tech enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to make significant efforts in the areas of technology finance, green finance, inclusive finance, old-age finance and digital finance. Also, we will actively support the development of new quality productive forces, and provide comprehensive foreign e change services along the entire chain for major national strategies, key areas, and weak links. Secondly, we will steadily advance reform of bank foreign e change operations by comprehensively optimizing the management framework for pre-transaction due diligence, differentiated review during transactions, and post-transaction monitoring and reporting, thereby achieving a better balance between improving efficiency and managing risks. Thirdly, we will establish a policy evaluation mechanism and an ecosystem assessment mechanism for foreign e change management. Taking alignment with national strategic goals, consistency with local development realities, and the tangible benefits delivered to enterprises and the public as key criteria, we will continuously boost the real impact of policies to ensure that people and businesses gain a stronger sense of fulfillment. Second, in terms of \"e panded opening-up\", we will promote high-level institutional opening-up in the foreign e change sector to support the development of a new system for a higher-standard open economy. We will strengthen the overall planning and systematic integration of reforms, promoting RMB internationalization and the high-quality opening-up of the capital account in a coordinated manner. In addition, we will enhance the integrated management of domestic and foreign currencies, thus fostering a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized. Firstly, we will deepen the reform of foreign e change managements for direct investment, streamline the foreign e change registration process for foreign direct investment (FDI), and shorten the negative list for fund use, so as to steadily support enterprises in participating in international cooperation across industrial and supply chains. Secondly, we will prudently and steadily e pand the connectivity of financial markets, and refine the qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII/RQFII) program, thus facilitating foreign financial institutions in investing and operating in China. Thirdly, we will advance the reform of foreign debt management by optimizing quota management, shortening the \"negative list\" for the fund use of e ternal debts, and gradually shifting the business of foreign debt registration to banks in an orderly manner. Fourthly, we will deepen the development and opening-up of the foreign e change market, improve the product system, e pand the range of market participants, and continue to enhance services for enterprises in managing e change rate risks. Fifthly, we will support region-specific opening-up and development, explore integrated reform and innovation of foreign e change management policies in pilot free trade zones, and actively support the development of key regions such as the Hainan Free Trade Port and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Third, regarding \"enhanced security\", we will strengthen the dual management framework of \"macro-prudential plus micro-regulation\" in the foreign e change market to safeguard its stability and ensure national economic and financial security. Adhering to a bottom-line thinking, we will enhance open regulatory capabilities and risk prevention measures, fostering a positive interaction between high-quality development and high-level security. Firstly, we will mitigate risks rising from e ternal shocks. We will intensify monitoring and early warning mechanisms for cross-border capital flows, strengthen macro-prudential management and e pectation guidance, and maintain the RMB e change rate at an adaptive and equilibrium level while ensuring a balanced international payments. Secondly, we will strengthen oversight in foreign e change. We will advance the shift to entity-based regulatory approaches in the foreign e change sector, crack down on illegal activities with heightened enforcement, and improve our capacity to identify and combat emerging criminal and illegal activities. Fourth, in \"upgraded intelligence\", we will leverage advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data to elevate the digital and intelligent capabilities of foreign e change regulation. Through the development of \"Smart Foreign E change Administration\", we will provide more intelligent, efficient, secure, and user-friendly services to individuals and businesses. Simultaneously, we will enhance the intelligence, precision, and effectiveness of risk identification and regulatory oversight, empowering foreign e change regulation with cutting-edge technological solutions. Ladies and Gentlemen, Currently, transformations of the world unseen in a century are unfolding at a faster pace. Confronted with drastic e ternal changes, we will conscientiously implement the guiding principles of the Political Bureau meeting of the CPC Central Committee held on April 25, committing ourselves to both goal-oriented and problem-oriented approaches, staying attuned to market demand, and rolling out a basket of supportive policies to keep employment stable, sustain business operations, maintain market stability, and anchor the expectations. Firstly, we will support foreign trade enterprises through multiple policy measures. We will further deepen the reform of trade-related foreign e change management by launching a suite of facilitating policies. For e ample, we will launch high-level opening-up pilot programs for e panding cross-border trade, encourage banks to include more trade-related entities in emerging industries into the targets of facilitating policy support, optimize foreign e change fund settlements for comprehensive foreign trade service providers, and facilitate the centralized overseas fund management for trustworthy engineering contracting firms. These policies are designed to support the innovation and development in trade. Secondly, we will proactively facilitate cross-border investment and financing. We will implement a facilitating policy mi to better support the international economic and trading cooperation and e change of personnel. For e ample, we will support research institutions across the country in attracting and leveraging foreign capital, further facilitate the cross-border financing and investment of technology-based companies, and shorten the negative list for the use of income generated under the capital account. We will promote nationwide the integrated RMB and foreign currency cash pooling program for multinational corporations, to facilitate the centralized use of fund within the corporate group. Through the pilot program for green foreign debt policies, we will encourage eligible enterprises to borrow foreign debts for green projects. Meanwhile, we will improve the fund management of domestic enterprises that list abroad by harmonizing the policies for domestic and foreign currency management, thereby facilitating the repatriation and domestic use of fund raised overseas. In the coming future, a batch of investment quotas under the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme will be issued, to meet the reasonable overseas investment demand by domestic entities in an orderly manner. Thirdly, we will implement a package of innovative policies related to foreign e change businesses in the pilot free trade zones, to actively support the strategy of upgrading the pilot free trade zones. The policy package includes measures such as optimizing settlement processes for new international trade forms, and e panding the pilot program for Qualified Foreign Limited Partnerships (QFLP), among a total of ten facilitating policies. Ladies and Gentlemen, Accelerating the construction of Shanghai as an international financial center is a major strategic decision made by the CPC Central Committee. It holds special significance in serving the new development paradigm and promoting high-quality economic growth. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in developing Shanghai as an international financial center. Today, Shanghai has evolved into a city with the most comprehensive financial market system, the most diverse range of financial institutions, and the highest level of financial opening-up in China. Since the beginning of this year, we have continued to step up support for building Shanghai into an international financial center. Not long ago, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the National Financial Regulatory Administration (NFRA), the State Administration of Foreign E change (SAFE), and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government jointly released the Action Plan for Further Facilitating Cross-Border Financial Services in Shanghai International Financial Center . Recently, the PBOC and the SAFE approved the plan for upgrading the functions of Free Trade Accounts (FTAs) in the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone and the pilot plan for comprehensive reform of offshore trade financial services in the Lin-gang Special Area. Moving forward, we will continue to strengthen the provision of high-quality policies and services to support entities of all types in participating in international competition and cooperation in a safer, more convenient, and more efficient manner. This will further enhance the competitiveness and global influence of Shanghai as an international financial center. To conclude, I wish the Forum a full success! Thank you!

Central bank speech | 07 July 2025 by Petar Chobanov PDF full te t (4kb) | 2 pages Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for inviting me to open today's event. The history of the euro is also part of Bulgaria's monetary history. Since the very adoption of the single European currency, our national currency has been pegged to it. Ever since we have been ine tricably linked to the economies of the countries using the euro. It is worth mentioning that the positive assessments by the European Commission and the European Central Bank about Bulgaria's readiness to join the euro area are a well-earned success for the efforts made. Despite the tense, uncertain and with an unclear future international environment, Bulgaria has managed to keep its stability and to make an enviable progress on the path of its economic integration. We have come a long way together and, of course, the challenges ahead of us remain. We need to continue purposefully and actively as a team in order to practically complete the process of our accession to the euro area. We are entering the intense second phase of the communication strategy for the adoption of the euro. The actual final work on the introduction of the new currency in Bulgaria is underway. The BNB has prepared a collection of summarised and systematised questions and answers, where the citizens and other interested parties can find answers to questions frequently asked by the public about the changeover to the euro. Today you can have a look at it and actively use it in the communication campaign. It is also published on the website of the Bulgarian National Bank. In this historic transition period, we very much count on businesses, trade unions, consumer organizations. The preparation for the dual display of euro and lev prices for goods and services is at its final stage, and now it can practically be seen in some places. The advance information for the population about the upcoming changes, the clarifications on occurring issues and difficulties, and any support provided during the transition period, would ease the future use of the new currency in a calm and secure environment. Trust in the business is an essential element of the economic situation, and I believe that the prices of goods and services will remain at a similar level and will not be a cause for tensions. Price stability is especially important for the development of the economy and affects people's living standard. In this regard, we rely on the trade unions with their e pertise to continue to be the link with the employed, to protect their interests, and to inform them about the important practical issues of the changeover. Consumer organisations, actively engaged in protecting consumers' interests, providing information on their rights, and e ercising control over traders, will continue to be an important factor for stability and trust in the economic processes. We can mention Estonia and Lithuania as good e amples for our country with regard to their entry into the euro area. As you know, they too operated under a currency board arrangement and participated in the E change Rate Mechanism II without changing their monetary regime. No major disruptions or problems have been seen in these countries, therefore we can e pect with a high degree of certainty that our e perience will also be successful and without major difficulties. For us, the euro area is an opportunity, and yet a responsibility – together we should carry out a smooth transition and outline prospects for better well-being and development. I wish you all productive work in the final stage of Bulgaria's accession to the euro area! Thank you for your attention!

      "content": "Rajeshwar Rao: Bridging the credit gap - the evolution of India's credit reporting infrastructure Keynote address by Mr Rajeshwar Rao, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the TransUnion CIBIL's Credit conference , Mumbai, 1 July 2025. The views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the BIS. Central bank speech | 07 July 2025 by Rajeshwar Rao PDF full te t (24kb) | 7 pages Ladies and gentlemen, Good Afternoon. At the outset, let me thank the organisers for inviting me to deliver the keynote address at this milestone event and congratulate Trans Union CIBIL (TU CIBIL) on its 25th anniversary. Credit reporting and TU CIBIL have grown together in India and the company has made a significant contribution in e panding the footprint of credit reporting in the country. Credit reporting systems today operate as a key element in the national financial architecture, encouraging greater credit access, supporting financial inclusion, enabling effective supervision, and enhancing financial stability. This silver jubilee therefore also represents a significant milestone in TU CIBIL's ongoing contribution to strengthening this framework. This also gives us an occasion to reflect on how the information gap between the credit institutions and the borrowers has been addressed over time and the possible way ahead. Evolution of Credit Information Companies in India To set a conte t to the theme of this speech, it may be worthwhile to reflect briefly on the evolution of credit information companies in India. The Reserve Bank had recognised the need for establishing a Credit Information Bureau for collection of credit information from lending institutions and for the provision of such information to the financial system and had set up a Working Group in 1999 for the purpose. Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd. (CIBIL) was thereafter incorporated in 2000, and over the years, three other Credit Information Companies (CICs) have also started their operations in India. A variety of challenges had hindered wider acceptance of credit information companies over the years. The key obstacles included inconsistent quality in data submitted by lenders and shortcomings in consumer protection mechanisms. Therefore, a committee was set up in 2013, to e amine the issues hampering the sector and based on its recommendations, significant policy changes were made in 2014 1 . These included standardisation of data formats for individual, corporate and micro finance borrower segments, institutionalizing the mechanism of Technical Working Group comprising of representatives from various regulated entities and introduction of Data Quality Inde for improving data quality. In the recent past, our focus has been on taking regulatory measures to improve quality of data and ensure faster redressal of customer grievances. Several policy measures have been taken to reduce information asymmetry, enhance data quality and improve customer satisfaction. Just to illustrate, these steps included mandating availability of free full credit report (FFCR) to individuals, appointment of internal ombudsman by CICs, e tending the Reserve Bank's Integrated Ombudsman Scheme to CICs, introduction of a framework for granting compensation to customers for delayed rectification of their credit information and increasing frequency of credit reporting. RBI directions have also mandated the CICs to display the list of suit-filed accounts of large defaulters and wilful defaulters on their website. The role of data and emerging technology in enabling credit access is therefore e tremely topical and relevant at this juncture. But if we were to go back in time, 25 years back, lack of information and high cost of access to information hindered access to credit to large segment of the populace, the financially e cluded. It was in this scenario that credit reporting started to take root in the country, and we have traversed a long road since then. Apart from greater access to secured lending, the creditors gain confidence to underwrite unsecured loans, facilitated by access to credit information provided by the CICs as this reduces the information gap that e isted earlier between even the prime borrowers and the lenders. While CICs have undoubtedly played an important role in reducing the information asymmetry thereby facilitating better credit decisions, they are not going to be the only game in town to source the required data, as information asymmetries are also sought to be addressed through other complementary mechanisms. This trend is driven by the digitalization of financial services and electronification of records which has created a large repository of data which can be used to get better handle on economic trends, both micro and macro. This coupled with the growth of FinTechs and innovations in financial services, has created business opportunities to harness alternate data sets in order to gain a better understanding of financial behaviour and credit worthiness of individuals and entities. These insights can give a richer perspective than conventional analysis and provide an impetus to the measures taken to foster greater financial inclusion. Let me highlight a few of these developments, technology led, and regulator supported. CERSAI and CRILC In 2011, the Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India (CERSAI) was incorporated, initially for operating a registration process under the provisions of SARFAESI Act. Over the years, it has developed into a complete registry containing security interest of immovable, movable, intangible properties and assignment of receivables. By providing access to all kinds of creditors and the facility for filing of attachment orders and court orders, CERSAI delivers a comprehensive status of any encumbered / attached property. 2 The Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC), was set up in 2013 by the Reserve Bank to collect, store and disseminate information on large credits of scheduled commercial banks, all India financial institutions and certain non-banking financial companies. These initiatives have undoubtedly helped banks and other financial institutions in improving their credit administration besides providing vital inputs for supervisory risk assessment on build-up of credit risk in the financial system. Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) At the heart of the FinTech revolution in India is India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) - a framework that integrates technology, markets, and governance to serve public interest. The DPI includes Unified Payments Interface (UPI) which is the flagship instant mobile digital payments system, interoperable across any bank account or app, Aadhaar Digital ID for over a billion adults, Aadhaar Payment Bridge which facilitates cash transfers directly to beneficiaries' bank accounts, Aadhaar Enabled Payments System (AEPS) which is an interoperable network of biometric based cash withdrawal & deposits, DigiLocker which is an e-Locker for storing verifiable credentials, Bharat Bill Payments System, now called Bharat Connect for bill fetch & pay, and FastTag - a near field communication based toll charges and parking collections platform. This is supplemented by the Account Aggregator Framework, another cog in the DPI, which is a cross-sectoral framework for consented financial data sharing. Apart from facilitating credit delivery, this is an initiative towards open finance. It has now come a long way and is growing rapidly with onboarding of financial institutions, since guidelines were first issued in 2016. The inclusion of Goods and Services Ta Network (GSTN) as a financial information provider under the account aggregator framework is e pected to give further impetus to cashflow based lending to MSMEs. Unified Lending Interface (ULI) The latest addition in the Digital Public Infrastructure for credit is the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), designed to simplify and democratize credit access by offering lenders regulated, seamless access to verified borrower data. The convergence of Jan Dhan Accounts, Aadhar and Mobile Phones, popularly known as the JAM trinity, UPI and ULI, represents a significant advancement in India's digital lending infrastructure. One of ULI's standout features is its ability to tap into alternative digital data, enabling access to credit even for those without formal financial histories. Its integration with NABARD's e-KCC portal is e pected to e tend access to customers of District Central Co-operative and Regional Rural Banks, previously e cluded from formal digital channels. Integration of state-level digitized data, such as land records and cooperative databases into the ULI framework, would provide novel cash flow-based lending solutions. Going forward, the potential for ULI to also harness data from e-commerce platforms and gig economy apps could open new doors for credit inclusion for small sellers, delivery workers, and freelancers. Improved access to credit When we evaluate the outcomes of these measures, we can see the significant changes and benefits. Over the years, India's household debt as a percentage of GDP has increased and stands at ~43 percent in 2024. This rising trend is fuelled more by an e pansion in the number of borrowers rather than just through an increase in average indebtedness 3 . Despite some moderation observed recently, the growth in deployment of bank credit under 'retail/personal loan' category witnessed a CAGR of appro imately 17 percentage over the past five years. 4 Moreover, the composite Financial Inclusion (FI) - Inde to measure and evaluate the e tent of financial inclusion too has improved substantially from 49.9 in 2019 to 64.2 in in 2024 indicating progress in deepening of financial inclusion in the country 5 . This reflects two important facets of credit that need to be borne in mind. First, the availability of credit to individual borrowers has improved and second the improvement in the FI- Inde reflects reduced frictions in credit delivery with consequential improvement in financial access. Digital initiatives for MSME sector A targeted beneficiary of increased use of data and technology in credit decisions should be the MSME sector, which remains the backbone of India's economy. With over 7.34 crore enterprises, contributing nearly one-third of our GDP and 46% of e ports, this sector is key to our economic future 6 . Increasing the availability of credit to the MSMEs has been a policy priority of the Reserve Bank and the Government of India. However, MSMEs have faced several challenges in accessing formal credit such as information asymmetry, e cess documentation and lack of transparency. Here the role of CICs has become important. When commercial credit reporting is efficient, creditors need to rely less on relationship lending and soft information, and more on facts and fact-based analyses based on credit reports and other credit reporting products. Rise of FinTech Ecosystem It needs to be recognised that of late FinTech players have emerged as powerful enablers, transforming how credit reaches previously unserved and underserved populations. By leveraging the power of technology, they have significantly lowered the cost and comple ity of delivering financial services to the last mile. This has not only improved user e perience but also addressed persistent challenges that had kept many outside the formal credit fold. Importantly, we are seeing a growing collaboration between FinTechs and traditional financial institutions. This partnership is particularly impactful in credit origination and supply chain finance, where it bridges gaps created by physical infrastructure and human resource constraints in remote and rural areas. For e ample, in FY 2024, FinTechs have processed appro imately 47% of small ticket personal loans of less than 1 lakh, by count. 7 Open Credit Enablement Network and Open Network for Digital Commerce The Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) that facilitates interactions among lenders, borrowers, and loan service providers, effectively uniting all participants within the credit ecosystem on a common platform to streamline credit delivery, is also poised to be a significant part of the fintech landscape. It is e pected to enable lenders to make more informed credit decisions by utilizing alternative data sources, such as cash flow information. Going forward, there is a promising scope for deeper integration between OCEN and the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). Such interoperability could democratise credit access further and open new avenues for MSMEs to participate in digital commerce, fostering broader economic growth on multiple fronts. 8 Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) for credit disbursement The proposed use of programmable CBDC for credit disbursement is another pioneering initiative. One commercial bank's pilot for tenant farmer lending under Kisan Credit Cards, where programmable CBDC ensures end-use monitoring, looks promising. Even without land records, tenant farmers are being e tended formal credit, based on livelihood activity tracking. If successful, this model could be replicated for collateral-free loans to micro-enterprises, street vendors, and artisans, where end-use assurance allows for responsible, productive lending. The digital nature of such disbursements also creates valuable digital footprints, which can enable further lending and reduce dependence on government schemes. Leveraging Tokenisation for Credit Delivery Tokenisation i.e. generating and recording a digital representation of financial or real assets on a programmable platform could be an option that can offer enhanced efficiency, transparency and accessibility, and may be seen as the next step following dematerialisation and digitalisation. It could favour small and medium enterprises' (SMEs') access to credit by narrowing the information gap. Further, SMEs could improve their collateral offering by tokenising real assets or trade receivables, thus improving their standing in the credit markets 9 . Tokenisation may also enable simultaneous asset transfer and payment in a financial transaction, minimizing counterparty risk and thereby considerably reducing the need for collateral. Role of AI/ ML in facilitating credit delivery One of the main challenges in the provision of credit facility, especially among underprivileged populations, is the absence of credit history. By using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), algorithms can evaluate alternative data from diverse sources to determine creditworthiness more accurately. In fact, it seems that time is not far when alternative data will no longer be alternate, but it will be the mainstream. This advancement would allow lenders to e tend credit to individuals who were once deemed ineligible. Use of AI/ML could simplify the disbursement process by automating credit assessments and risk evaluations, which not only accelerates fund distribution but also cuts administrative costs, making it practical to offer small loans even in remote regions. Moreover, AI models e cel at uncovering previously hidden insights in data, enabling financial institutions to more precisely forecast their clients' funding requirements and creditworthiness. They also streamline compliance workflows, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, which significantly cuts operational costs and increases their speed of lending. Microfinance and microloans which serve as crucial support systems for underserved communities are likely to be the biggest beneficiary of this advancement. Grameen Credit Score Another initiative that is on the anvil is the Grameen Credit Score. This score will be in addition to the existing credit score and will be specifically designed to enhance financial inclusion in rural areas, particularly for members of self-help groups (SHGs). It aims to address the limitations of existing generic credit scoring systems by creating a tailored framework for assessing the creditworthiness of rural borrowers. This measure can improve access to formal credit for rural populations, including farmers and marginalized communities. Role played by the Reserve Bank In this dynamically evolving scenario, the Reserve Bank has been endeavouring to create an enabling regulatory environment for fostering innovation and ensuring financial system integrity. With a view to put in place a regulatory framework for FinTechs that maintains a balance between ma imising their creative potential while minimising the idiosyncratic risks they pose to the financial system; the Reserve Bank issued a Framework for Self-Regulatory Organisation(s) in the FinTech Sector in 2024. The Reserve Bank Innovation hub, a wholly owned subsidiary of RBI, commenced an initiative to foster a vibrant infrastructure for facilitating the progress of FinTechs in the country. The initiative - Fintech and Startup Acceleration (FAST) - aims to connect the stakeholders, viz., the startups, incubators, accelerators, investors, regulators and banks and financial institutions to accelerate innovation and financial inclusion. Through the HaRBInger initiative, Reserve Bank is encouraging the global innovation community to solve real-world problems with a special focus on inclusive design and accessibility for differently abled persons in the digital finance journey. To foster continuous innovation, we have made the Regulatory Sandbo 'on tap' and 'theme-neutral'. Even as we embrace these sweeping changes, we must remain cognizant of the need for addressing issues around data accuracy, data security, and model risk. These could present significant challenges in the effective deployment of data-driven systems. Inaccurate or incomplete data can undermine the reliability of analytical outputs and decision-making processes, while poor data security can e pose organizations to breaches, resulting in legal liabilities and reputational damage. Additionally, the use of comple AI and machine learning models introduces concerns around model risk, especially when these models are not thoroughly tested, validated, or monitored for biases and performance drifts. Rigorous validation protocols, continuous monitoring, and robust governance frameworks are essential to ensure that these models remain fair, transparent, and aligned with regulatory and ethical standards. While we should be willing to embrace new technologies and modern regulatory approaches, the core values - integrity, transparency, and commitment to public service - should drive our innovation and initiatives towards financial inclusion. Innovation needs to be responsible and accountable. It should not be at the cost of an individual's rights regarding the use of their personal data. Looking ahead The path ahead is filled with opportunity and responsibility. For the CICs let me outline two critical enablers i.e. (i) Enhancing Data Freshness and (ii) Improving Data Quality. Currently, credit data is refreshed on a fortnightly basis. We must aspire to more frequent updates. Real-time or near-real-time credit reporting will improve underwriting precision, enable timely reflection of borrower actions like loan closures or repayments and deliver a superior consumer e perience. This shift requires investments in technology, process reengineering, and change management. But the rewards - transparency, efficiency, and trust, far outweigh the costs. Similarly, data quality is the bedrock of responsible lending and Reserve Bank has always emphasised the importance of accuracy in regulatory submissions. It has been prescribed that CICs shall provide a data quality inde score to the Credit Institutions (CIs) on a monthly basis to facilitate improvement in the quality of data submitted by CIs. Another key challenge is identity standardization. CICs rely on credit institutions to provide accurate and validated IDs. Without this, duplication and misreporting remain risks. We must move towards a unique borrower identifier, which is secure, verifiable, and consistent across the system. We stand on the cusp of a transformative financial era where technology, policy, and innovation converge to democratise credit access. Various initiatives, collaborative partnerships and sustained regulatory support are laying the foundation for a more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable economy. But at the heart of a sustainable credit landscape lies an empowered consumer which is enabled when we have a financially aware and literate customer. While regulations mandate transparency and awareness, the responsibility needs to be fulfilled by all of us. Financial literacy cannot be achieved through a one-time campaign; it has to be a sustained commitment for all the institutions and entities involved. While the institutions in the financial system have done commendable work, the journey is far from complete. The setting up of Credit Information Companies was in one sense the starting point of this journey of financial inclusion and democratisation of credit. Even as the journey continues, the role of the CICs remains integral and important in realizing the vision of Total Financial Inclusion. Thank You.

Good morning, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Board. I am pleased, though not surprised, to see such great interest in the topic of today's conferenceâthe integrated review of the capital framework for large banks. I want to thank Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman for having the great idea of holding this event at the outset of her term. I would also like to thank Fed staff for their tireless work in putting the conference together. Today we will hear the perspectives of industry veterans, academics, and current and former policymakers who are all well-versed in the operations of large banks and the main pillars of the capital framework. A great benefit of this conference is the chance to consider all elements of the capital framework in concert, rather than look at each in isolation. We need to ensure that all the different pieces of the capital framework work together effectively. Doing so will help maintain a safe, sound, and efficient banking system, for the benefit of the people we serve. The U.S. bank capital framework includes risk-based capital requirements, leverage requirements, the surcharge for the largest and most comple banks, and the stress tests. We will discuss the status of each of those elements, and the road ahead, in a comprehensive manner. As this audience will know, we have proposals outstanding or in the works across all four areas. Our regulatory capital framework and all banking rules are implemented through supervision, an area where Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman brings deep e perience as a former banker and state supervisor. As she has noted, we need to make sure that our supervisory practices focus on the critical areas that determine safety and soundness. We need our large banks to be well capitalized and to manage their key risks well. And we need large banks to be free to compete with one another, with nonbank financial firms, and with banks in other jurisdictions to provide capital and support economic growth. The Fed is a dynamic institution. We are open to hearing new ideas and feedback on how to improve the capital framework for large banks, and I look forward to hearing from today's participants.

July 17, 2025 The Case for Cutting Now Governor Christopher J. Waller At the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York, New York Share Thank you, John, and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. My purpose this evening is to e plain why I believe that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should reduce our policy rate by 25 basis points at our next meeting. 1 I used to tell my junior research colleagues that presentations are not murder mysteriesâjust tell the audience up front \"who did it\" by telling them the main point. So let me follow my own advice and state up front the reasons I believe we should cut the policy rate at our meeting in two weeks. First, tariffs are one-off increases in the price level and do not cause inflation beyond a temporary surge. Standard central banking practice is to \"look through\" such price-level effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored, which they are. Second, a host of data argues that monetary policy should be close to neutral, not restrictive. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was likely around 1 percent in the first half of this year and is e pected to remain soft for the rest of 2025, much lower than the median of FOMC participants' estimates of longer-run GDP growth. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, near the Committee's longer-run estimate, and headline inflation is close to our target at just slightly above 2 percent if we put aside tariff effects that I believe will be temporary. Taken together, the data imply the policy rate should be around neutral, which the median of FOMC participants estimates is 3 percent, and not where we areâ1.25 to 1.50 percentage points above 3 percent. My final reason to favor a cut now is that while the labor market looks fine on the surface, once we account for e pected data revisions, private-sector payroll growth is near stall speed, and other data suggest that the downside risks to the labor market have increased. With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate. Let me e plain my reasoning by starting with my view of economic activity. Given the ups and downs of monthly indicators of GDP this year, we can best get a view of the performance of the economy by combining the first- and second-quarter numbers. With the data in hand, estimates suggest that real GDP increased at an annual rate of about 1 percent in the first half of this year, compared with 2.8 percent in the second half of 2024. That comparison is important not only for the e tent of the slowdown, which is considerable, but also because it is well below most estimates of the potential growth rate of the economy. Based on forward-looking indicators, I don't e pect a rebound in the second halfâin fact, most forecasts suggest that real GDP growth will remain around 1 percent at an annual rate. While the recent ta bill has a significant number of elements that will spur economic growth in the future, not much of those effects will show up this year. The slowdown in GDP is evident in consumer spending, which constitutes about two-thirds of economic activity. After hovering near 3 percent last year, real personal consumption e penditures (PCE) growth is estimated to have stepped down to 1 percent in the first half of this year. This morning the Commerce Department announced June retail sales. The data are consistent with this forecast, as the increase is on the heels of a couple of soft monthly readings. As we move forward this year, consumer spending is e pected to continue to grow at a similar pace, tempered by the e pected slowing in growth of real disposable income because of the temporary effects of tariff increases. I will say more about tariffs when I discuss inflation, but in assessing the near-term momentum of the economy, tariffs could well be a factor. Turning to the \"soft\" data, this picture of declining momentum is consistent with what I am hearing from my business contacts and other sources. The Fed's July 16th Beige Book reported mi ed evidence on economic activity across Federal Reserve Districts, with 5 reporting slight or modest gains and the remaining 7 having flat or declining activity. 2 This mi ed news is also found in surveys of purchasing managers where there is a continuing contraction in manufacturing and a slight e pansion in nonmanufacturing activity. Given that firms outside manufacturing represent the large majority of businesses, this implies a modest e pansion in activity. Now let's talk about the labor market. The headline numbers from the June jobs report looked reassuringâthe unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent, within the range it has been for the past year, and payroll gains were reported as 147,000, essentially the same as in May. But looking a little deeper, I see reasons to be concerned. Half of the payroll gain came from state and local government, a sector of employment that is notoriously difficult to seasonally adjust this time of year. In contrast, private payroll employment grew just 74,000, a much smaller gain than in the previous two months, and that is consistent with other surveys you might have read about that found a drop in private-sector employment. 3 I focus on private-sector employment not only because it is the lion's share of employment, but also because it is a better guide to the cyclical movement in employment than counting public and private sector together. As I used to tell my students, the Federal Reserve's job should be to ma imize private-sector employment, not government employment. And there is another reason to cite the slowdown in private-sector hiring. A pattern in data revisions in recent years tells us that the private payroll data are being overestimated and will be revised down significantly when the benchmark revision occurs in early 2026. Accounting for the anticipated revision to the level of employment in March 2025 and e trapolating forward, private-sector employment gains last month were much closer to zero. 4 This is why I say private-sector payroll gains are near stall speed and flashing red. This is only one month of data, I realize, and one possible factor in the slowdown in private-sector hiring could be a deceleration in net immigration this year, although it will take time to get a clear picture of how immigration is affecting employment. But other data support the idea of a slowdown in hiring. There are widespread media reports of the difficulty new college graduates are encountering in finding jobs, and, in fact, the unemployment rate for new grads is at a 10-year high, far above the level before the pandemic. 5 Looking across the soft and hard data, I get a picture of a labor market on the edge. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey reports continued low rates of firing but also low rates of hiring. I suspect this is a hangover of a labor market that was very tight after the pandemic, leaving employers resistant to let go of qualified workers for fear of renewed labor shortages. That said, purchasing managers report caution and even some pauses on hiring. The June 4th Beige Book reported declining labor demand in every single Federal Reserve District, and the July 16th Beige Book emphasized that labor demand continued to be less than labor supply in many industries. With hiring already low, at a certain point, declining demand would overcome any instinct to hold on to workers, and if that attitude does shift, it implies that a larger and more sudden reduction in payrolls and an increase in the unemployment rate are a risk. To sum up here, I see the hard and soft data on economic activity and the labor market as consistent: The economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly, and the risks to the FOMC's employment mandate have increased. Let's turn to the inflation data. In the past two days, we received June consumer and producer price data that give us a good idea of the inflation rate based on PCE, the FOMC's benchmark for monetary policy. After several months of readings that moved the 12-month inflation rate closer to the FOMC's target, the consumer price inde and the producer price inde suggest that total PCE inflation moved up to around 2.5 percent in June, and core inflation likewise rose to roughly 2.7 percent. I believe these data reflect some modest effect from tariff increases, which began in February, and I believe there are further tariff-induced increases to inflation to come later this year, with the asterisk that there remains a lot of uncertainty about how trade agreements or escalations in trade conflicts may affect that outcome. To understand how tariffs are affecting prices, I have been following not only the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly data, but also studies of high frequency price data. For e ample, some researchers this year are tracking the short-run price impact of tariffs on goods prices in real time by e amining product-level price data from online stores of large U.S. retailers. 6 Using data through mid-July, they find that, on net, imported goods prices have increased modestly while domestic goods prices are little changed. Looking across country of origin, Chinese goods imports have seen the most persistent and steady price increases. That said, to date, the data point to very small goods price increases relative to the size of the tariff rates. This finding is consistent with my view that a large share of tariff increases won't be passed through to consumers. My presumption has been that consumers will have to pay about one-third of the price increases from higher tariffs, with the remainder split between foreign suppliers and U.S. importers. So if there is a permanent increase to import tariffs of about 10 percent, I e pect this will raise PCE inflation three-tenths of 1 percent this year, and that this increase would fade over the next year or so. 7 I can think of a couple of other reasons that may limit the impact on consumers. The first is that the slowing down of the rollout of many tariffs, with multiple postponements for continuing negotiations, may be giving U.S. importers time to substitute finished or intermediate goods to domestic suppliers or foreign sources subject to lower tariffs. A second reason is that, faced with the slowing economy that I have described and the likelihood that tariffs will be weighing on consumer spending, foreign producers and importers may be finding ways to hold the line on prices to maintain their presence on store shelves and hold on to customers. In fact, slowing demand increases competition for all firms, and consumers may benefit. Finally, despite all of the discussion of supply chain disruptions, tariff effects on supply chains are completely different than what happened during the pandemic. In the pandemic, supply chains were actually broken: Many workers were not working, factories were idle, and waves of COVID were hitting at asynchronous times across the globe. In contrast, in the case of the higher tariffs, we know e actly where things are being produced, and nothing is brokenâfirms are simply arguing about prices and who will eat the tariffs. Once that gets resolved, goods will flow naturally across the globe but potentially using different routes. It is possible, of course, that tariffs may have a larger effect on inflation than I e pect, but that won't affect my view of the implications for monetary policy. As I have said many times, tariff increases are a one-time boost to prices that do not sustainably increase inflation. In the absence of an unanchoring of inflation expectations and an acceleration of wage growth, which we have not seen, tariffs won't and can't permanently increase the inflation rate. What does this mean for monetary policy? Research shows that central bankers shouldâand, in fact, doâlook through price-level shocks to avoid needlessly tightening policy in times like these and damaging the economy. 8 The key question for monetary policy right now is what we can discern about the underlying rate of inflationâthat is, the rate e cluding tariffsâbased on the fundamentals of the economy. Federal Reserve Board staff has done work to try to estimate tariff effects on PCE prices. 9 Using that methodology, if I subtract estimated tariff effects from the reported inflation data, I find the inflation numbers for the past few months would have been quite close to our 2 percent goal. You're not going to hear \"mission accomplished\" from me, but what this tells me is that underlying inflation has been lower than what is reported and close to our objective. Besides tariffs, I don't e pect an undesirable, sustained increase in inflation from other forces. Among the reasons for this are that the rate of growth in labor compensation is down considerably in the past year or two, and, with the softening labor market, I do not e pect workers will be able to get large wage increases going forward. Combining this with solid rates of productivity growth implies inflation should continue around 2 percent. Two more points support my inflation outlook, and I will only summarize them here since I discussed them at length in my June outlook speech. 10 The first addresses the question of whether I could be making the same kind of mistake my FOMC colleagues and I made in 2021 and 2022 in e pecting inflation increases to be only transitory when they turned out to be persistent. But unlike then, there is no pandemic disrupting labor, goods, and services supply around the world, and economic growth is now slow and slowing, rather than e panding rapidly. These differences bring me to the second point, which is that unlike in 2021 and 2022, when expectations of future inflation rose, today the measures of expectations I watch remain firmly anchored. 11 To sum up, tariffs have boosted, and will continue to boost, inflation a bit above the FOMC's 2 percent objective this year, but policy should look through tariff effects and focus on underlying inflation, which seems to be close to the FOMC's 2 percent goal, and I do not see any concern for forces driving it persistently higher. As I hope will be evident by now, the evidence of a slowing economy, and all the factors I have cited weighing on economic activity, mean that the risks to the FOMC's employment mandate are greater, and sufficient to warrant an adjustment in the stance of monetary policy. Based on June's Summary of Economic Projections, the current target range for the federal funds rate of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent is 125 to 150 basis points above the participants' median estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate of 3 percent. While I sometimes hear the view that policy is only modestly restrictive, this is not my definition of \"modestly.\" In fact, the distance that must be traveled to reach a neutral policy setting weighs heavily on my judgment that the time has come to resume moving in that direction. In June, a majority of FOMC participants believed it would be appropriate to reduce our policy rate at least two times in 2025, and there are four meetings left. I also believeâand I hope the case I have made is convincingâthat the risks to the economy are weighted toward cutting sooner rather than later. If the slowing of economic and employment growth were to accelerate and warrant moving toward a more neutral setting more quickly, then waiting until September or even later in the year would risk us falling behind the curve of appropriate policy. However, if we cut our target range in July and subsequent employment and inflation data point toward fewer cuts, we would have the option of holding policy steady for one or more meetings. For this reason, I believe it makes sense to cut the FOMC's policy rate by 25 basis points two weeks from now. And looking to later this year, if, as I e pect, underlying inflation remains in checkâwith headline inflation data reporting modest, temporary increases from tariffs that are not unanchoring inflation e pectationsâand the economy continues to grow slowly, I would support further 25 basis point cuts to move monetary policy toward neutral. 1.

As long as inflation expectations are anchored, both nominal wage growth and inflation in the post-shock period should be able to continue at pre-shock rates, as neither has been upset by a rise in inflation expectations, and output and employment can also grow along paths that are undisturbed by the shock.

July 17, 2025 AI: A Fed Policymaker's View Governor Lisa D. Cook At the National Bureau of Economic Research, Summer Institute 2025: Digital Economics and Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge, Massachusetts Share Watch Live Thank you, Avi. It is an honor to be back with you at the NBER Summer Institute. Thanks to you, Erik, and Catherine for organizing these insightful and thought-provoking sessions this summer. 1 Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing across the globe and permeating every corner of the economy at an incredibly rapid rate. This has significant implications for Federal Reserve leaders, both as policymakers and managers of the organization. AI is transforming the economy, including by accelerating how quickly we generate ideas and making workers more efficient, and that, in turn, will affect both sides of our dual mandate of ma imum employment and price stability. AI also is beginning to affect the way we conduct economic research within the Federal Reserve System, with the potential to make some tasks more efficient, harness nontraditional data in new ways, and broaden and deepen economic analysis. I believe we are at an inflection point. As I have stated before, I, like some of you here today, see AI as the next general-purpose technology (GPT) 2 . As many of you in this room know and have written about, GPTs, like the printing press or electric power, matter immensely to innovation. 3 Similar to those seminal advances, AI will likely spread throughout the economy more broadly, spark innovation, and improve over time. Among large language models (LLMs), the highest scores on benchmark intelligence tests have almost doubled over the past 12 months, according to the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Inde . 4 The competition to improve is fierce: The leaderboard for the AI lab offering the best model switched si times in the past half a year. And the technology is diffusing rapidly. ChatGPT launched about three years ago, and now more than half a billion users engage with the internet-based LLM weekly. 5 LLMs are super cool and grab the headlines, but there is a lot more to AI, which can be an important driver of productivity. Advances in multimedia generation is another way to think of AI's fast advancement. It took human creators decades to move from silent pictures to \"talkie\" movies; AI models accomplished this advance in less than a year. AI is poised to alter the contours of the global economy. In doing so, it has the potential to materially affect both sides of the Fed's dual mandate. On the ma imum-employment side of the mandate, AI can generate new tasks and jobs and possibly eliminate others, similar to many past technological innovations. On the price-stability side of our mandate, AI can improve productivity, which can lower inflationary pressures, but it can also boost prices in the interim, as AI adoption may lead to a surge in aggregate investment. Studying the net effects of AI on the economy over time will be critical to setting appropriate monetary policy. However, at the Fed, we are not only considering AI's implications for the economy but also employing strategies to harness the technology's power inside our walls. Commensurate with rapid improvements in AI, its adoption is accelerating across government and industry. As a result, there is an urgency for the Fed to both study AI's effects and capture more of its benefits to maintain a highly productive workforce and e tract additional insights from new economic analysis. Having spent much of my career studying the innovation production function and collecting and e amining data on the economic effects of technology, productivity, and innovation, I am coupling caution with this optimism. This is consistent with my view when I was a research associate here at NBER and when I first spoke about AI at the NBER AI meeting in Toronto in 2018 before I joined the Board of Governors. While I see AI adoption as broadly beneficial to the economy and society, I know from economic history and the history of technology that there could be many multidimensional challenges to adopting it. With that in mind, I will start by offering general principles I believe guide our society's engagement with AI. Ne t, I will describe recent progress on AI research at the Fed. I will then say a bit about both the opportunities and constraints I see affecting the wider adoption of AI. Finally, I will offer some brief remarks on how AI factors into my thinking on monetary policy. Responsible AI Adoption I want to start by stressing that any organization engaging with this technology should take a thoughtful and structured approach to AI adoption. I can offer four guiding principles for what I view as responsible AI adoption. First and foremost is establishing strong governance and risk management. A central tenet of good governance should be the mindset that humans are in the loop, because it ensures that people guide AI rather than allow AI to guide us. In a speech last year, I told a story about how Benjamin Franklin lost a game of chess to a machine called the \"Mechanical Turk\" 6 Of course, there was a human chess master hidden inside. What might seem like a silly tale contains an important lesson for organizations and governments deploying AI: Like the Mechanical Turk, ultimately the human inside the machine is still in charge. Relatedly, organizations also must be careful about privacy, cybersecurity, and leakage of confidential and internal information. A second principle is that education and training of staff are critical to get and keep employees at the technological frontier. A third principle is empowerment. Teams within organizations should be encouraged to learn by doing and engage hands-on with AI technologies in controlled environments. Finally, a fourth principle is e perimentation. Organizations should maintain a spirit of openness while retaining the ability to halt projects that do not meet rigorous standards. AI Research at the Fed Like many other leading organizations and researchers around the world, the Federal Reserve is working hard to understand AI's implications for our mission and our own work. To be clear, the FOMC is not using AI in developing or setting policy, but rather to aid staff in their other tasks such as writing, coding, and research. For e ample, we have been deepening our understanding of the capabilities of LLMs and other machine learning models to produce economic insights. 7 Several Fed papers document what we are learning. Board economists Wendy Dunn and Nitish Sinha, with coauthors Ellen Meade and Raakin Kabir found that LLMs have surprisingly good understanding of economic topics discussed in the FOMC minutes. 8 In a recent paper, Board economist Paul Soto measured AI research and development by e amining firms' earnings conference calls using deep learning. 9 Richmond Fed economist Anne Hansen, with coauthors, John Horton, Sophia Kazinnik, Daniela Puzzello and Ali Zarifhonarvar found partial success in simulating the Survey of Professional Forecasters' panel using an LLM and create synthetic forecasters that often achieve superior accuracy, particularly at medium- and long-term horizons. 10 A paper by Mary Chen, Matthew DeHaven, Isabel Kitschelt, Seung Jung Lee, and Martin Sicilian used machine learning techniques on a variety of unstructured te tual data to identify and forecast financial crises. 11 Another paper, by Leland Crane, Emily Green, Molly Harnish, Will McClennan, Paul Soto, Betsy Vrankovich, and Jacob Williams, harnessed the ability of an open-weight model to read Work Adjustment and Retraining Notifications to create a real-time measure of layoffs. 12 As our researchers e amine LLMs and other machine learning techniques critically, some research has demonstrated the benefits of AI, and other research has provided important insights about its limits and where we should be careful about AI. By actively engaging with and learning about AI tools in our research, we not only enhance our analytical capabilities, but also gain invaluable insights into the broader economic implications of AI. Researchers at the Fed are also e amining the state of AI adoption and the potential of AI to affect our economy. A timely indicator of generative AI (GenAI) adoption in the U.S. has been developed by St. Louis Fed economist Ale ander Bick, along with his coauthors Adam Blandin and David Deming, through a repeated survey. 13 They also find that, so far, GenAI adoption for uses outside of work has been faster than personal computer (PC) adoption after its introduction. In the workplace, they find GenAI adoption has happened at a similar pace as occurred with PCs. Work from David Byrne and Paul Soto, along with coauthors Martin Baily and Aidan Kane, suggests that GenAI has the potential to be a GPT and could benefit the economy in other ways too such as by being an invention that itself leads to more innovation. 14 In addition, Fed staff from across our divisions keep abreast with the rapid developments in GenAI by engaging regularly with other researchers and experts from academia, other central banks, and the industry through various seminars, workshops, interviews, and invited presentation series. Simultaneously, the research at the Fed is proceeding deliberately and cautiously, as many AI tools are not yet ready to be put into production. For e ample, Leland Crane, Akhil Karra and Paul Soto show that when it comes to real-time analysis, LLMs suffer from look-ahead bias and frequently get confused by the vintage nature of economic data releases. 15 Even for historical analysis, the researchers note: \"From the perspective of historical analysis, an LLM may not reliably recall the details of real time data flow during historical episodes, limiting the reliability of historical analysis.\" The Speed of Adoption Our e perience with AI at the Fed is also informative about why we are not seeing more widespread adoption of AI in the economy, despite its remarkable pace of improvement and the apparently large potential economic gains. First, as in all industries grappling with AI, the workforce must be trained to take advantage of a rapidly changing technology that is strikingly different from previous technologies. Often, the premise of technology has been to automate routine tasks where the steps involved are predetermined. The premise of AI is different from technologies of the past. AI promises to augment areas of work involving human judgement, which do not follow any predetermined steps. Thus, education and training must evolve. Second, large organizations learn to use new tools through hands-on e perimentation and shared e periences, and it takes time for the knowledge to diffuse. Some of these are planned and organized, while others are more organic and spontaneous. For e ample, earlier this year, the Board hosted an AI e po where AI early adopters shared their e periences with AI and innovative AI use cases. Events such as this showcase cross-functional, cross-organizational collaboration among participants throughout the Federal Reserve System and demonstrate how AI-driven solutions could address challenges in areas such as economic analysis, financial stability, and operations. These venues provide e cellent avenues for sharing successes and failures in trying out different use cases and, in many cases, enable the broader community to engage with prototypes of AI applications. In addition to demystifying AI and encouraging its use, these events try to establish and promote cultural norms of responsible AI usage, which generates ideas related to the types of problems AI is better or worse at solving. Finally, organizations will also have a rational desire to be selective about which advances to adopt when the technology is rapidly changing. For e ample, we are seeing that some highly effective prompting strategies for older models are no longer necessary for thinking models. As with any new general-purpose technology, there is likely to be an e tended period of learning by doing. This will be particularly important for the high-profile LLM models. With these models, even the developers are not fully aware of their capabilities, and organizations, including the Fed, learn about their abilities and limitations only once they are put to use. Implications for Monetary Policy Given what we know, as well as what we learn from researchers like you, we are thinking carefully about the implications of AI for monetary policy. As AI filters through the economy, it has the potential to affect both sides of our dual mandate in different ways. As with other technological innovations, AI is poised to reshape our labor market, which in turn could affect our notion of ma imum employment or our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. I see it as likely that AI will allow workers to be more productive while also changing the tasks associated with any given job. As with many technological breakthroughs, a certain set of jobs may be replaced. We must recognize the challenges and potential pain this may bring, and we are watching this closely. A successful response to these disruptions will be of paramount importance but lies outside the mandate of monetary policy. Fortunately, new types of employment, whether tasks or occupations, are also being created. In terms of price stability, AI is likely to boost productivity and could help the economy achieve higher growth while reducing inflationary pressures, because those productivity improvements can counter labor cost increases. In addition, the ability of AI to process and analyze ever larger amounts of data will likely lead to advances in scientific research and innovation, resulting in an increased arrival rate of ideas, further amplifying its effect on productivity. As I have noted in recent speeches, it is possible that the disinflationary effect of AI could, over time, counter any factors putting upward pressure on inflation. 16 It is also possible that AI could boost prices in the interim, as adoption of the technology might require a surge in aggregate investment. I am constantly monitoring incoming data, the ever-evolving outlook, and a broad range of risks to both sides of the dual mandate. I tend to be cautiously optimistic when I anticipate what AI could bring to the economy, but much uncertainty remains. As I have laid out for my institution specifically and the economy broadly, AI is a technology that is rapidly evolving, and it is good to be humble about our understanding of its e act effects on our economy and the timing of those effects. Conclusion To conclude, I see us at a moment of inflection where AI is being deployed as a general-purpose technology. Babies born today will ask what life was like before LLMs, just as today's college students quiz us about what life was like before the internet and mobile phones. This is a moment for e citement and optimism, but also one we are taking seriously at the Federal Reserve. As I have described, AI will both change the economy for which we set policy and change how we can best operate as a central bank. Much more remains to be learned and understood about how AI will affect our economy and our everyday lives.

July 17, 2025 A View of the Housing Market and U.S. Economic Outlook Governor Adriana D. Kugler At the Housing Partnership Network Symposium, Washington, D.C. Share Watch Live Thank you, Robin. And thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on the important topic of housing and how housing fits in with the broader economy. 1 First, I want to step back and say that housingâour homesâhas a central role in our lives beyond what statistical reports capture. Housing matters greatly for our welfare because shelter is a basic human necessity. Our homesâbe it city apartments, farmhouses passed through generations, or suburban dwellingsâare among the most significant places in our lives. In terms of household finances, housing is an important source of wealth for many American families. Housing also supports access to good jobs, because the jobs people can take depend on where they live and how far they need to commute. In addition, the housing sector matters a great deal to the economy as a whole, and it is an important channel through which monetary policy is transmitted. That is why I study it closely as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). From the perspective of the labor market, many workers have ties to housing-related sectors, including construction, real estate, and the mortgage finance industry. And because housing is a large fraction of household wealth, the housing market influences consumer spending. From the price-stability perspective, shelter has a large weight in measures of inflation. Specifically, shelter is currently 16 percent of the e penditures in the basket used to calculate the personal consumption e penditures (PCE) price inde , which is the FOMC's preferred inflation measure. 2 Today I will discuss several aspects of housing affordability in the U.S., a topic that I know is important to many of you, as it is to me. When studying affordability, it is important to distinguish between the cost of shelter, by which I mean the cost of occupying a home, and the costs of purchasing and owning a home. I will discuss each of these in turn, with the common theme being that both are elevated from a historical perspective. Ne t, I will discuss some supply and demand factors that e plain how we got to this point and offer some thoughts on how these influences might evolve. Finally, I will discuss my overall outlook of the U.S. economy and its implications for monetary policy. Cost of Shelter I will start with a discussion of the cost of shelter, which is not only needed for survival, but is also a large portion of household budgets. Because of this, increases in shelter prices leave less for families to spend otherwise. It is common to measure the price of shelter with rents because rent reflects the price of occupying a home. Rents surged early in the pandemic recovery, rising 8.3 percent over the 12 months ending in December 2022. This year, rent growth eased to 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending in May. 3 The recent increase in multifamily construction has contributed to this moderation. For lower-end properties, we have not seen as much of a cooling in rental inflation, in part because new construction has been aimed at the high end of the market. Even with the slowdown in rent growth, rents continue to rise faster than overall inflation, as was the case before the pandemic. 4 Nevertheless, rents have not risen at a faster pace than household incomes. The constant-quality cost of a rental unit relative to the median family income is currently no higher than its average from 2014 to 2019. The share of renters spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent was about the same in 2023 as it was in 2019, about 40 percent in both years. Of course, this fraction is high, indicating that rental housing is a large e pense for many families. This ratio is significantly higher for certain groups. In 2023, 43 percent of Hispanic households spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent, while 47 percent of Black households spent that share. For households whose head did not attend college, the figure is 46 percent. 5 Cost of Homeownership While shelter is a necessity, homeownership is an opportunity because it is a pathway for families to build wealth. It also provides a greater sense of stability because owner-occupants do not have to worry about a landlord deciding not to renew the lease. Like renting, the costs of purchasing and owning a house are elevated. The cost of homeownership is related to several factors. One is the cost of purchasing a home. Like rent, house price growth has slowed from the fast pace seen a few years ago, and this slowing has been more pronounced for higher-priced homes. Zillow's inde for high-value homes increased 1 percent per year over the past three years, whereas it increased 3 percent per year for low-value homes. 6 Despite this slowdown, the level of prices is quite high, even relative to income. The ratio of house prices to median family income is about 20 percent higher than its average from 2014 to 2019. In addition, the costs associated with owning a home are also elevated. Mortgage rates have ranged between 6 and 7.5 percent in the past several years. Property ta es have risen along with home values. Homeowners insurance premiums have increased as insurers seek to offset e penditures tied to recent natural disasters and the rising cost of replacing structures. Federal Reserve Board staff research shows that, factoring in high house prices, mortgage rates, property ta es, and homeowners' insurance, the costs of owning a home relative to median income in 2023 were at the highest level seen since 1980. 7 Given these costs, it is no surprise that some families cannot afford a home. Board staff research shows that increases in mortgage rates reduce purchases by lower-income borrowers, especially low-income first-time homebuyers. 8 And, indeed, the homeownership rate of heads of households younger than 45 decreased from 2022 to 2024. This decline is a partial reversal of changes seen in the previous few years when a combination of very low interest rates and fiscal support caused ownership rates to rise. Yet, on net, the ownership rate for several groups remains above levels recorded before the pandemic. In 2024, homeownership rates for household heads aged 35 to 44 were 62 percent, 2 percentage points above their 2019 level. The ownership rates for Black households were 4 percentage points higher, and the rate for Hispanic households was 1.5 percentage points higher. 9 Demand Factors The relative affordability of housing is the outcome of the forces of supply and demand. Let me first focus on the long-run trends on the demand side, where household growthâthat is, the change in the number of households over timeâplays an important role. Household growth is a function of population growth and household size. In the 10 years before the pandemic, the U.S. population rose slightly less than 1 percent a year. Immediately following the pandemic, population grew at a faster rate, reflecting a higher volume of immigration. That trend has since reversed. Academic research e amining immigration flows finds that rent growth increases in the short run after a wave of immigration, but these rent increases may not persist if the housing supply e pands over time to meet the increase in housing demand. 10 In fact, a study found that increases in immigration do lead to more residential construction. 11 In terms of the whole population, the Census Bureau projects that population growth will ease over the next 10 years but remain positive, based on mortality rates, birth rates, and the age distribution of the population. 12 Thus, population growth should put less upward pressure on demand for housing going forward. Let me turn to some cyclical forces on the housing demand side, with some factors pushing demand in opposite directions. A strong labor market for several years has fueled demand for both renting and owning housing, while the recent increase in mortgage rates and other costs of ownership have damped demand for owning. Supply Factors Turning to housing supply, it is no surprise to those in this room that it has been increasing at too slow of a rate relative to demand. Research shows that growth of the housing stock has declined steadily since the 1960s and 1970s. Specifically, it estimates that if the housing stock had e panded at the same rate from 2000 to 2020 as it did from 1980 to 2000, there would be 15 million more housing units in the U.S. 13 Research finds that local regulations are an important factor constraining the housing supply, leading to higher house prices. 14 In response, some state and local governments have begun to enact policy changes aimed at rela ing these supply restrictions. For e ample, in 2020 Minneapolis enacted a large-scale zoning reform that eliminated parking requirements for new development, encouraged apartment development in commercial corridors, and permitted duple and triple construction on all residential lots. These zoning reforms may have boosted construction in Minneapolis. Other states and cities have also implemented policies intended to increase the number of housing units, but it is still too early to tell whether these changes will meaningfully affect house prices or rents. Material and labor costs for home construction have increased about 25 percent in real changes at the national level could further increase those costs. Anecdotal reports, including those in the Beige Book, suggest that changes in immigration policy are starting to restrict the supply of construction workers. Research has found that past declines in immigration have reduced residential construction while increasing housing prices. 16 In changes, to date there has been some effect on homebuilder costs. The National Association of Home Builders estimates tariff policy, including tariffs on steel and aluminum, has increased the cost of new construction by about 3 percent of the average price of a new home, and additional tariffs, such as the one proposed on imported lumber, could raise construction costs further. Another aspect of housing supply is the number of homes for sale. Elevated interest rates have made it much less appealing for existing owners who have a mortgage with a low fi ed rate to sell and purchase a different house, because doing so would require them to take out a new mortgage at a much higher rate. Therefore, the supply of existing homes for sale in the past few years has been much lower than normal. Board staff research shows that this \"rate lock-in\" effect has boosted house prices in markets that were already tight in 2019, because the decrease in homes for sale was proportionally larger than the decrease in the number of potential buyers. 17 Considering all these factors in concert, the housing market has gone through some pronounced swings over the past four years. Looking through these ups and downs, growth in demand for shelter has continued to outpace supply, putting upward pressure on rents across a wide range of locations and types of families. Although rent growth has not been faster than income growth, rental e penditures are still a large fraction of income for many households. House prices have risen, too, and combined with elevated mortgage rates and increases in other ownership costs, the costs of owning a home are high relative to Americans' incomes. Looking forward, growth in housing demand may soften over the second half of this decade because of a slowdown in population growth. But even with this softening, it is not clear that growth in the housing supply will be large enough to meet demand. Prospects for house prices and rents over the next few years also depend materially on the economic outlook, to which I will turn now. Economic Outlook I will start by saying that while my discussion so far has focused on the housing market, I look at economic conditions across the entire economy and in every region of the country when making monetary policy decisions. Thus, I pursue the monetary policy that I believe will achieve our dual-mandate goals of ma imum employment and price stability for all Americans. Overall, I see the labor market as stable and resilient, and economic activity moderating some. In contrast, I see upward pressure on inflation from trade policies, and I e pect additional price increases later in the year. While I am monitoring policy developments in many areas, I continue to see trade developments as the key drivers of the U.S. economic outlook. Starting with price stability, based on data received this week, it is estimated that the headline PCE price inde rose 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in June, a somewhat stronger gain than the 2.3 percent recorded in May. Core inflation, which e cludes volatile food and energy costs and is a good guide for future inflation, came in at about 2.8 percent in June, also higher than in May. Both headline and core inflation have shown no progress in the last si months. While core services inflation decreased relative to the end of last year, core goods inflation has pushed up inflation recently. I see firmer core goods inflation as already partially reflecting the pass-through of increased tariffs, which has been shown by research done at the Fed. 18 In addition, CPI and PPI reports released in the past two days show that increases in core goods prices were more broad-based in the month of June. While many forecasters may have been e pecting a sooner and sharper increase in overall inflation, there are many reasons to think that larger effects of tariffs are still coming. First, businesses built up inventories ahead of anticipated tariff increases, giving them leeway to still sell goods at pre-tariffed prices. Second, given the many changes in implemented tariff policies, businesses may not yet be passing the higher tariffs to their selling prices because they are waiting for greater clarity. Third, businesses, especially larger ones, may also be waiting to capture market share from others that hike prices sooner. Fourth, the current environment of still-elevated short-run inflation expectations makes it easier for workers to seek higher wages and business to charge higher prices, which could increase the persistence of price hikes going forward. Fifth, tariff rates could increase further, as seen in newly proposed reciprocal tariffs for several countries and the new tariffs on copper introduced last week, putting further upward pressure on prices. Other unforeseen shocks, such as geopolitical ones, may further push inflation upward soon. Board staff research shows that increased geopolitical risk is associated with high inflation in the U.S., with effects peaking about two years after the geopolitical shock. 19 Renewed tensions in the Middle East, together with the possibility of an e tension and escalation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, are important geopolitical risks to monitor. Turning to the employment side of our mandate, I see a labor market that has been stable and resilient. The June employment report showed that employers added a robust 147,000 jobs, boosted by jobs in the state and local government sector. Private payroll employment increased by 74,000, showing some moderation relative to previous months. Additionally, the unemployment rate has stayed in a narrow and historically low range for more than a year. Layoff measures have remained subdued, and the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has largely been stable at a level that suggests demand and supply for labor are roughly balanced. Conclusion Considering the near-term outlook that I just outlined, I see that the U.S. economy has remained resilient, with labor markets appearing to be stable and close to full employment. Inflation, meanwhile, remains above the FOMC's 2 percent goal and is facing upward pressure from implemented tariffs. Moreover, I judge that inflation is likely to increase further as tariff effects build up during the rest of the year. Given the stability in the employment side of our mandate, with the unemployment rate still at historically low levels, elevated short-run inflation expectations, and goods inflation rising due to the upward pressure from tariffs, I find it appropriate to hold our policy rate at the current level for some time. This still-restrictive policy stance is important to keep longer-run inflation expectations anchored. Moving forward, I will make policy decisions based on incoming economic data, the evolving outlook, and my assessment of risks to both sides of our dual mandate. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. 1.

July 16, 2025 Booms and Busts and the Regulatory Cycle Governor Michael S. Barr At The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. Share Watch Live Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. 1 I am here to discuss one of the most important resources that policymakers have: the lessons of history. In discharging my responsibilities at the Federal Reserve, I have been thinking a lot about history. Its study provides the opportunity to step out of the particular circumstances of today to inform our understanding of the core issues at the heart of financial regulation. While we must be attentive to new and even unprecedented challenges, e perience shows that understanding the lessons of history gives policymakers a great advantage. Many of the decisions we face today have, in some form, been confronted by previous generations of policymakers. In these remarks, I want to discuss a particular pattern in the history of the financial system, which is the relationship between regulatory weakening and the economic and financial cycle of booms and busts. My intent is not to re-hash well-e amined facts or to go over past historical episodes chapter and verse. Rather, I aim to offer a perspective on this historical throughline that focuses on the regulatory cycle. It's widely accepted that the economy and financial system e perience cyclical booms and busts. Booms have historically been characterized by a multitude of good things. These can include fast economic growth, workers who had been sidelined entering the workforce and improving their lives, and financial innovations that often make credit or investments more readily available. At the same time, some of the characteristics of a boom economy, such as rapid increases in credit and in financial market activity, as well as greater risk-taking and leverage, can sow the seeds of busts. In busts, economic activity and lending contract and asset prices decline. This can lead to rapid deleveraging and dislocation throughout the financial system, which worsen the downturn, causing job losses and business closures, homes lost and lives upended. There are usually multiple causes that drive booms and make busts so terrible, some unique to each individual episode. But one factor that is common to many past cycles of boom and bust is weakening financial regulation. Weakening regulation often drives risk-taking and increases bank fragility during the boom, making the ensuing bust more painful. Indeed, economic research suggests that weaker regulation leads to more bank failures, setting the stage for worse recessions. 2 Moreover, because the financial system evolves so rapidly, regulation must also continuously adjust. Much regulatory weakening occurs simply when regulators fail to keep pace, while at other times, there is a deliberate action to lower regulatory burden that ends up miscalculating the risk involved. Let me be clear here that, when I refer to regulatory weakening, I mean not only direct deregulatory actions by regulators or legislators, but also failure of the regulatory framework to keep up with changing circumstances. In principle, financial regulation should incentivize banks to engage in responsible risk-taking and build up resources in good times, so that they can deal with times of financial stress and continue their vital role in the economy in bad times. The prosperity that accompanies a healthy economy should allow banks to invest in improved risk management and strong financial resources. However, a healthy economy can also reduce the effectiveness of regulatory constraints on bank risk-taking. This can occur for a host of reasons, including behavioral biases, political pressure, market dynamics, and the tendency for innovation to move more quickly than regulators. These dynamics can result in regulatory weakening during boom times. When actively pursued, this weakening often appears justified at the time and may be implemented by well-meaning policymakers who simply miscalculate the long-run effects of their actions. My purpose in these remarks is to recount several boom-and-bust episodes in American history and identify some lessons that can guide policymakers entrusted with the responsibility of promoting a strong and stable banking system. This history demonstrates the connection between regulatory weakening and cycles of boom and bust. I don't mean to suggest that more regulation is always better or that repealing and reforming regulations isn't sometimes appropriate to remove obsolete rules and relieve unnecessary burden. But, if we can at least agree that regulation should seek to limit devastating financial crises, then the history that I will describe today offers some lessons for anyone thinking about regulatory policy. There are, of course, lots of e amples to choose from, both in the United States and abroad, but I'll focus on the Great Depression, the Savings and Loan (S&L) crisis, and the Global Financial Crisis. I will then discuss some possible reasons that similar episodes could recur and conclude with some thoughts on the lessons we can learn. The Great Depression Let's start with the biggest and most widely studied bust in U.S. history, the Great Depression. Scholars continue to debate its causes, which were multiple and comple . One compelling argument focuses on the failure of regulation to keep pace with the innovations of the Roaring Twenties. As I said, I view such regulatory stagnation as a form of weakening. This weakened regulatory environment played a role in setting the stage for and then e acerbating the bust. Weakened regulation that had failed to keep up with the times left banks unable to weather shocks to the economy. The banking sector's collapse was a significant factor in making the Great Depression the most severe economic crisis that this country has ever e perienced. 3 The Roaring Twenties e pansion was powered by the post-war recovery and technological advances in transportation, manufacturing, and communications. Stock markets grew quickly to help finance this innovation, while residential and commercial real estate investment surged and swelling demand for consumer durables led in turn to increased demand for financing. 4 As credit needs escalated, there was intensifying competition among banks; savings and loan institutions (S&Ls); and rapidly growing nonbank finance companies, trust companies, and other financial vehicles. The 1920s were also characterized by high levels of financial speculation, both inside and outside the banking sector. Banks engaged in speculation through nonbank affiliates and supported speculation by lending. At the same time, many banks were relatively thinly capitalized and overly concentrated, especially given the lack of federal deposit insurance at the time. In addition, many states had prohibitions on branching that prevented banks from diversifying their portfolios and inhibited local competition, keeping many struggling banks alive. 5 The stock market boomed, margin lending grew dramatically, and insider trading and market manipulation were rampant. As the financialization of the economy increased, the regulatory framework failed to keep up. Outdated branching restrictions remained, failing to reflect the size and dynamism of the modern economy. Banks gained permission to engage in new activities, such as real estate lending and certain activities in the securities markets; however, capital requirements and other rules were not adjusted to reflect potential increased risks from these new activities. 6 The cumulative effect of these events was a significantly weakened regulatory environment and a substantial buildup in risk, without a commensurate increase in resources to allow the sector to withstand the risks posed. Looking back, we know that, when the economic shock hit, the banking system magnified that shock. The boom of the Roaring Twenties started to go bust in 1929, when the fast growth of the past decade turned to contraction, followed by a series of financial and banking crises. In all, appro imately 9,000 of the nation's 23,000 banks failed, resulting in major losses to depositors, given the lack of federal deposit insurance, and a significant contraction in credit that deepened and lengthened the economic downturn. 7 Notably, banks in states that had more robust regulatory frameworksâfor e ample, those that applied higher capital requirementsâhad lower rates of failure. 8 In response to the financial collapse in the Great Depression, Congress adopted reforms aimed at addressing risks that had driven those panics. Among these steps, Congress established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and federal deposit insurance to reduce the risk of bank runs and protect retail depositors. Congress increased regulatory oversight of banks and separated commercial and investment banking. Congress also enacted strong securities laws and created the Securities and E change Commission (SEC). Overall, these steps helped stabilize the financial sector and ushered in a long period of quiescence in banking. The Savings & Loan Crisis My second e ample today is the S&L crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s, which did substantial harm to millions of Americans and the financial system and was e tremely e pensive to resolve. In this episode, in contrast to the Great Depression, affirmative deregulation led to e cessive risk-taking by S&Ls, as well as banks, during a boom period. As circumstances soured, revealing weaknesses, Congress attempted to bolster the S&L sector by loosening the regulatory framework further. This failed to resolve the underlying stress and instead further fueled the buildup in risk-taking, worsening the losses in the subsequent bust. Let me first set the stage. The years leading up to the S&L crisis were characterized by dramatic growth in business credit, in the course of the economic e pansion that began in 1982. At the beginning of this period, the S&L sector primarily served the residential real estate market because of restrictions on S&L activities. These restrictions eased over the 1980s, allowing S&Ls to get significantly larger and engage in new kinds of lending; however, these changes were not accompanied by sufficient regulatory enhancements to account for increased risks. This e pansion in S&L activity also presented new competition with commercial banks, which had themselves built up significant risks as they e panded into new activities. 9 At the same time, both S&Ls and banks were increasingly under pressure due to both high inflation and high interest rates, which disrupted their funding models. 10 Competition for customer funds increased dramatically, especially because of the rise of money market mutual funds, which had grown rapidly. When Congress removed outdated deposit rate caps to allow banks and S&Ls to more effectively compete for funds, it did so without implementing adequate safeguards against these institutions taking on e cessive risk. This led many S&Ls to engage in increasingly risky projects to compensate for escalating funding costs. Banks also increased their deposit rates and took on more risk. As vulnerabilities at S&Ls became evident, Congress, federal regulators, and the states attempted to bolster both sectors with the hope of allowing them to outgrow those weaknesses. For instance, Congress and the states reduced restrictions on S&Ls' ability to invest in commercial and consumer loans. 11 These changes contributed to the boom in commercial real estate lending, which became a key source of vulnerability. In addition, Congress and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the federal S&L regulator at the time, weakened capital requirements and the enforcement of those requirements for the S&L sector. 12 This allowed institutions to become weaker and poorly capitalized entities to stay afloat, leaving S&Ls as a whole badly positioned to weather adverse conditions. The bust, when it came, was severe. S&L losses continued to mount throughout the 1980s. Many banks also e perienced severe stress. These difficulties were amplified by an eventual decline in real estate values and problems in the agricultural and energy sectors. In 1980, there were just under 4,000 S&Ls. By 1989, that number had fallen to below 3,000, with over 500 of the remaining institutions insolvent as judged by book value. And over 1,600 banks failed between 1980 and 1994. Regulatory weakening had propped up tottering institutions, allowing zombie institutions to persist, accumulating much greater losses than they otherwise would have. The process of cleaning up the sector began in earnest in the late 1980s and continued into the mid-1990s, with a final cost of $160 billion, roughly 5 percent of gross domestic product at the time. 13 And the cost of resolving insured banks that failed during this period was $36 billion. 14 Congress implemented significant reforms in response to the S&L crisis, including stricter capital and accounting requirements, limits on insured depository institutions' investment powers, and e pansions of regulators' enforcement authority. These changes paved the way for stability in the banking sector for some time. The Global Financial Crisis I'll turn now to my final e ample, the Global Financial Crisis, which had devastating effects for the millions of people who lost their livelihoods, their homes, and their businesses. In the decade leading up to the crisis, America e perienced rapid credit growth and a housing boom. There was optimism about the benefits of financial innovation, such as securitization of home loans, and belief in the power of market discipline as a form of self-regulation. Home prices and mortgage debt accelerated in tandem, driven by a mutually reinforcing cycle of optimism, with home prices roughly doubling between 1997 and 2006, and even larger increases in mortgage debt. 15 Amid this boom, lending standards dropped, driven by investor demand for mortgage-backed securities, which were increasingly opaque and risky in their design but still highly rated by the rating agencies. There was substantial growth in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, including new forms of credit derivatives. Money market funds boomed, becoming increasingly linked to the off-balance sheet business of banks. 16 These developments led to the emergence of large, short-funded, and interconnected financial entitiesâboth banks and nonbanks. The regulatory environment failed to keep up with these changes in activity and the increasing comple ity of financial institutions and markets, and regulatory weakening heightened vulnerabilities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, enacted in 1999, permitted the creation of financial holding companies that could engage in the full range of financial activities; however, the act did not put in place a regulatory framework commensurate with the full range of financial risks and permitted nonbank firms such as investment banks and insurance conglomerates to compete with banks wholly outside its framework. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 e empted OTC derivatives transactions from virtually all regulation and oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and SEC. In the lead-up to the crisis, regulators cut oversight further. A striking image from the time featured the head of one financial regulatory agency wielding a chainsaw to demonstrate his commitment to slashing regulations. 17 The competitive landscape and regulatory lacuna led to a race to the bottom in standards for underwriting and issuing mortgage loans and securities, and transactions became increasingly funded by opaque and unstable short-term wholesale funding. Consumers were left unprotected as the subprime crisis grew. In addition, the largest investment banks, which were overseen by the SEC, increased their leverage with heavy reliance on short-term funding, leaving them increasingly vulnerable to any losses. These are just a few e amples of the widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision that occurred in both the banking and nonbanking sectors in the lead-up to the crisis. The resulting recession and financial crisis saw the deepest and longest contraction in economic activity since the second world war, the collapse of large financial institutions, significant government support to keep the financial system afloat, and a prolonged period of slow growth. In response to this crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, a reform package that, among other things, strengthened bank capital, addressed off-balance sheet e posures, and provided for stress testing. Consumer protections were strengthened, and a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was established. Supervisors ramped up forward-looking supervision. In addition, banking regulators adopted capital and liquidity reforms, which substantially improved the resiliency of the banking sector. Studying the role that regulatory weakening played in the crisis provides a powerful reminder of the importance of preserving these regulatory gains. Lessons for Policymakers Reviewing these three e amples together, it is striking to see the pattern of regulatory weakening during a boom, including the failure of the regulatory environment to keep pace with the evolving financial sector, and how this weakening lays the foundation for a subsequent bust. Why do we continue to see these cycles? Some reasons are psychological, others political. Humans have short memories, especially for e periences we might like to forget. The further we get from a crisis, the more its causes fade from memory and the less likely a recurrence seems. We become more likely to view regulations as unduly burdensome and place less value on the protection they offer from downside risk. The financial sector itself lobbies hard to weaken regulation, which is often effective when the last crisis seems far away. Credit cycles, financial innovation, and the evolving needs of the economy are also significant contributors. As the economy changes, so do financing needs. This makes it harder to recognize when things are running too hot. In addition, regulators are understandably cautious about restraining innovations that have societal benefits, which may hinder their ability to reduce associated risks. Longstanding regulations can be subject to regulatory arbitrage, making them less effective as activities migrate outside the regulated system. These dynamics make the financial sector unstable, feeding the boom-and-bust cycle. How can we do better? The first lesson is to approach the financial system with a through-the-cycle perspective and avoid thinking \"this time is different.\" In each of the booms I have covered, there was a heady confidence that market discipline would control risk-taking, that downside risks were so implausible as not to merit attention, and that easing regulation was justified. With such confidence, insufficient thought was given to how regulatory weakening might create new vulnerabilities. A bit of humility would have helped. While it is true that regulation must evolve with the economy and financial system, we need to recognize that rela ing rules can create vulnerabilities. Changes in the markets themselves can also weaken the effectiveness of regulations. The second lesson is that policymakers should resist the pressure to loosen regulations or to refrain from imposing regulation on new activities during the boom times. With past economic downturns in the rearview mirror, regulations start to be seen as a limitation on growth, rather than necessary protection against vulnerabilities. As became evident in past episodes, vigilant supervision and prudent rules on risk-taking are important to prevent future crises. While there is a tradeoff, it is important to have appropriate protections in place to reduce the risks and costs of the resulting busts. Third, regulation cannot be static. If regulation fails to keep up with evolution of the financial sector, it can create new risks or hinder growth. To conclude, an important lesson we can draw from U.S. financial crises is the role that ill-advised weakening of the bank regulatory framework played in those crises. It is well within our ability, and is our duty as regulators, to learn from these episodes to avoid making the same mistakes. In doing so, we can help to ensure that the financial system is prepared to weather downturns and continue to serve households and businesses. 1.

Before 1900, national banks were prohibited from underwriting, dealing, or investing in securities. However, federal authorities loosened these restrictions by allowing national banks to establish bond departments that could underwrite, sell, and invest in debt securities.

Federal regulatory authorities did not interfere with these affiliate activities. Scholars continue to debate the e tent to which this underwriting activity was risky for the banks.

Money market funds also similarly funded other parts of banks' balance sheets in the lead-up to the crisis.

Knight Chair in Defense and Strategy July 16, 2018 7 min read Bluesky Streamline Icon: https://streamlinehq.com Bluesky Print Editor's note: Steven Heydemann and Michael O’Hanlon argue that a pragmatic plan for Syria would protect America’s friends and allies while allowing reconstruction and refugee return to begin, reducing the odds of a future e tremist takeover. The United States cannot be sure that Russia would agree to such a deal, but Moscow has incentives to end this war, too. This piece originally appeared in The National Interest . As the White House prepares for the July 16 summit between American President Trump and Russian President Putin, Syria will be on the agenda. President Trump has signaled his interest in winding down the U.S. military presence in that country’s long and tragic civil war. In e change, according to press reports, President Trump may ask Putin to contain Iran’s influence in Syria, a huge lift given the scale of Iran’s presence in the country, and the critical role it has played in the Assad regime’s military gains since 2015. With such a promise by Putin, together with further progress in the fight against ISIS in the country’s east, Mr. Trump might then declare mission accomplished and pull the United States out of Syria entirely. This would be a major mistake for several reasons. First, Russia has broken too many of its commitments in Syria to take Putin’s guarantees seriously. For e ample, Russia has been bombing opposition positions in southwest Syria in recent days even though it signed a de-escalation agreement with America and Jordan promising not to do so last year. Second, the degree of Russian leverage over Iran, or even over the Assad regime, is questionable. In the past, Iran and the regime have brushed aside Russian efforts to reshape the political and diplomatic landscape in Syria—most notably in dismissing Putin’s recent statement that all foreign forces must leave the country. Third, if the United States abandons any role in Syria, it will undermine just about the only remaining source of leverage the U.S. has to shape the trajectory of the Syrian conflict. In the midst of yet another barbarous regime offensive in southwest Syria, which is displacing additional tens of thousands of innocent civilians, turning America’s back and ceding the field entirely to President Bashar al-Assad would be a moral outrage. It would also sow the seeds for the resurgence of ISIS 2.0—just as Shia abuse of Sunnis in Iraq under Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki gave rise to ISIS (“al Qaeda 2.0”)—in that country in 2013/2014. American officials may hope that the U.N.-sponsored diplomatic process in Geneva could rescue the situation by negotiating an end to the Assad regime and a new national unity government. But that story is a fairy tale. Assad, who holds most of the military cards in Syria now, has no interest in being negotiated out of power, especially in favor of a majoritarian government that would inevitably be Sunni-dominated—and thus quite possibly seek vengeance against Assad and his fellow Alawites. Fourth, actions that signal that the U.S. is no longer concerned with the outcome of the conflict will make it far more difficult for Washington to help Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon with the war’s ultimate fallout, and with the return or relocation of refugees. Additionally, it will make it much harder for the U.S. to influence the shape of any future regional security architecture and temper the influence of hostile actors in the Middle East. Admittedly, seven and a half years into this tragic conflict, there are no good answers. However, some outcomes are much less bad than others. For instance, it is still realistic for the United States to help protect its Kurdish partners in the country’s northeast. Furthermore, America can secure some limited protections and temporary autonomy for friendly opposition forces and the populations they represent elsewhere. Moreover, it is important to begin reconstruction and the return of refugees in parts of Syria outside of the regime’s control. It is also possible to work with other countries to try to pressure Assad out of office over time in favor of a somewhat more tolerable successor. These steps will also reduce the odds of an ISIS 2.0 emerging, will limit (though hardly end) Iran’s influence in the country, and hold out at least some prospect of addressing the larger strategic effects of the regime’s victory. The core elements of a strategy that would seek to achieve the above objectives, without significantly e panding the role of American military forces in the Syria conflict, should include the following: First, recognize that the Geneva process will not replace Assad with an elected government or a truly representative government of national unity. Instead, adopt the longer-term goal that Assad will choose his own successor, subject to approval by the international community, with a cabinet of advisors and ministers that would include individuals from the country’s other major regions and sectarian groups. Assad remains unlikely to accept such a compromise, but it may be the best America can hope for, and it is consistent with statements from Russian and Iranian leaders about the need for post-conflict reforms in Syria’s government. In the short term, use negotiations with Damascus and Moscow to pursue protections for various autonomous zones in opposition-dominated regions within Syria. This could start with the country’s Kurdish northeast, which should be split into at least two such zones to mitigate Turkish worries about Kurdish secessionism. Similar autonomous areas should be pursued for areas mainly in opposition hands, notably in the country’s northwest near Idlib, if possible. American and international assistance should then start flowing to these zones. However, e cept for very limited humanitarian aid, such assistance should not be given to the central government or any regions Assad still rules, until he steps down in the manner indicated above. American forces should stay on the ground in roughly their current numbers, to help with reconstruction and to ensure the autonomous areas remain secure until Assad is gone. In addition, U.S. funding for stabilization programming in opposition-controlled areas should be restored immediately. American and allied airpower should remain available, if need be, to retaliate against any regime or Iranian attacks on American or friendly positions. The United States cannot be sure that Russia would agree to such a deal. If it did America cannot be confident it has the political capital to assist in carrying it out. But Russia does have incentives to end this war, too. This type of pragmatic plan for Syria would protect America’s friends and allies while allowing reconstruction and refugee return to begin, reducing the odds of a future e tremist takeover. And it is certainly better than trusting Russia to evict Iran from Syria, or trusting Assad to show mercy to his own people. The emergence of an ISIS 2.0 or similar e tremist movement could easily be the result of an abrupt American departure and therefore should be avoided.

Knight Chair in Defense and Strategy November 23, 2016 7 min read Bluesky Streamline Icon: https://streamlinehq.com Bluesky Print In an otherwise e cellent column on November 13, “ The two immediate tests for Trump’s foreign policy ,” Jackson Diehl strongly critiques Mr. Trump’s initial thinking towards the Syrian war. Specifically, he states that: “U.S. alignment with Russia will quickly alienate America’s Sunni allies such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan, which see the Syrian civil war as a pro y fight with Iran.” Just back from a trip to Amman during which I met with a number of high-ranking government officials, I am confident that this is in fact not the case, at least not in Jordan. Burdened by 1.3 million Syrian refugees, or almost 20 percent of the nation’s own population, Jordan has an acute interest in seeing the civil war in Syria end. But it has deduced, after five years of watching the Obama administration seek to simultaneously defeat ISIS while pressuring President Assad out of power there, that it is important to have priorities. The U.S. approach has not worked. Even if it has gradually weakened ISIS, it has done nothing to weaken the al-Qaida derivative in Syria commonly called al-Nusra (now renamed the “Conquest of Syria Front” to mask those roots). Nor has it reduced the intensity of the civil war. Indeed, without declaring this to be government policy, one official said to me that “there is a growing sense in the region that perhaps one is better off with the devil one knows”—meaning Assad, rather than a successor regime that could include jihadi elements, or the absence of any meaningful central government. Most of all, many e press a willingness to consider new strategies and approaches at a time when the old way has clearly failed. On November 10, the Post ran an e cellent news story e plaining that President Obama has recently authorized greater use of intelligence assets to gain information about the Conquest of Syria Front, so that the group can be attacked more effectively. Until just recently, the United States tolerated the Front, which is often intermi ed on the battlefield with more moderate insurgent fighters. Recognizing how little pressure was otherwise being placed on the brutal Syrian dictator, the United States had been reluctant to go after the Front, even after agreeing last summer with Russia that we should in fact collectively take it on. In this conte t, Trump’s apparent willingness to attack both ISIS and the Front actually foreshadowed a decision that Obama was just about to make himself. None of this is to e press admiration for Mr. Trump’s foreign policy thinking, which in general I find underdeveloped at best, dangerous at worst. However, in regard to Syria in particular, there may be opportunities to work together with both Russia and regional states. And this is probably necessary. As another Jordanian official told me, “any solution likely requires cooperation with Russia.” What both Trump, and Russia, and key regional actors need to appreciate is that Assad himself cannot of course be the answer. Of course, it is not quite that simple. What both Trump, and Russia, and key regional actors need to appreciate is that Assad himself cannot of course be the answer. He may be the devil we know—but he is in fact a devil. Having killed most of the 400,000 or more who have died in this conflict and driven millions from their homes, Assad simply has too much blood on his hands to be a stabilizing and legitimate ruler of all of Syria ever again. He is despised by large segments of the Sunni Muslim majority in Syria, who have seen their neighborhoods shelled and barrel-bombed, and their populations deprived of food and medical care, for more than half a decade in this terrible war. We might temporarily defeat ISIS, only to see another wave of Salafist jihadism follow. And the war would go on. So what kinds of longer-term strategies are available to us? Persuading Assad to step down in favor of a new, power-sharing government might be the theoretically most appealing approach. It has been U.S. policy for more than half a decade. However, it has gone nowhere. Perhaps things will change, but especially after the Russian intervention in the war last year, and resulting changes in battlefield momentum, Assad shows no interest in leaving office. That leaves some type of territorial compromise as the most logical goal. If there will not be power-sharing within a strong central government, there can be power-sharing regionally. Such devolution of governance can take various forms. There could be one or two autonomous zones in some parts of the country (as with Kurdistan in Iraq), with Assad still in power in Damascus. Or there could be a new, relatively weak national government stitching together a federation or confederation of largely self-governing entities (as in Bosnia). There might even be a Swiss-style cantonment system. Whichever solution is ultimately negotiated by Syrians with outside support, Assad’s future role would have to be limited to truly governing only those parts of Syria where Alawites and Christians are in the majority. My own view is that a formal confederation is the most militarily achievable and politically sustainable. In the end, Syrians can and must do the choosing, of course. But we owe them an open mind, and options. For five years, the international community has been assuming that only a strong central state, with a new government, can be the outcome of this conflict and negotiation process. That approach has been unduly restrictive. And it has failed miserably.

Ferris, Kemal Kirişci April 26, 2016 Achieving a stable outcome in Syria will require more than clever diplomacy and a willingness to attack both ISIS and the Conquest Front. The United States should still support moderate opposition fighters in this conflict. They have done too much—including to help defeat ISIS in the north, and helping to stabilize the Syrian-Jordanian border in the south—for us to abandon them. In fact, we need to do more to help them militarily. Otherwise, Assad and Russia will not agree even to a system of autonomy, or of confederation. We need both more diplomatic fle ibility AND more military leverage. So Mr. Trump is not wrong. But his view to date is incomplete, because collaboration with Putin cannot be the whole answer to solving our combined problems in Syria—and Assad as the future president of the whole country certainly cannot be the answer, either. A broader vision for what the future Syrian state can consist of, with more options, is needed soon. If Mr. Trump can embed his ideas for collaborating with Russia against ISIS and the Conquest of Syria Front within a broader strategy that aspires to the creation of a new type of Syria in which all groups have rights and safety in the future, his instincts might just help. It is too soon just to dismiss it out of hand.

What is needed is a political strategy for Syria that squares this circle. This piece originally appeared on USA Today . The U.S. cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base is a welcome development. It sends a strong message to President Bashar Assad that chemical weapons will not be tolerated and to Russia that the United States is not afraid to act. It also signals to the world that President Trump is capable of using American military power assertively yet responsibly. But there is no obvious military step that could follow. Russians are present at some other air bases in Syria, making it hard to strike those facilities. In any event, hitting fi ed sites from standoff range never threatened Saddam Hussein’s rule in Iraq during the Clinton administration and now is unlikely to threaten Assad’s. No broader strategy is yet in place to do what is truly needed in Syria—defeating both ISIS and al-Qaeda while gradually ending the civil war. We need to think hard about what comes next. The Trump administration has oscillated in recent days between saying on the one hand that Assad has a fairly firm grip on power and on the other that, as Secretary of State Re Tillerson just declared , it is hard to see Assad being part of the long-term picture in Syria. Both sentiments are understandable. The first is a realpolitik assessment of where things stand in Syria militarily. The second is the correct moral judgment—and more than that, it reflects the fact that Sunnis and Kurds in Syria cannot really be e pected to live under such a brutal leader any longer. What is needed is a political strategy for Syria that squares this circle. Assad must go, yet he will likely stay. That is a parado that requires creative thinking. It also requires compromise, since no one favors a U.S.-led Iraq-like invasion to displace him definitively, and since the Geneva process created during the Obama years to negotiate a new government in Syria never really had a chance. Two changes in our strategy are needed. First, we need more friendly military power on the ground in Syria, both to liberate cities held by ISIS and to make Assad feel the heat so he will negotiate. Second, we need a short-term way to protect Sunni and Kurdish Syrians in autonomous zones that would be governed and protected separately, even if Assad remains nominally in charge. His removal can be achieved more slowly and gradually, as long as those whose people have been massacred can get out from under his rule in the meantime. To create more combat power among friendly forces on the ground, we will need to work more intensively with Kurdish and moderate Sunni groups. President Obama was moving in this direction, albeit much too slowly, but he then ran up against a Turkish roadblock: Turkey did not want us to arm the Syrian Kurds lest they transfer weapons to Turkish Kurds who might use them in terrorist attacks in Istanbul, Ankara, or other parts of Anatolia. There are several ways to address these Turkish fears. Don’t give weapons to the Kurds—loan them, with future economic aid to the Kurds contingent on their eventual return. Commit now to have American forces on the ground near the Turkish-Syrian border as part of a future peacekeeping force. And, finally, require at least two separate autonomous zones for Kurds rather than a singlezone. Turkish forces could remain in place to keep them separate (preventing their pursuit of an independent Syrian “Kurdistan”). We also need to figure out how any autonomous zones would be assisted and protected more generally, and how Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin would be persuaded to accept them. The recent strikes actually can help by reestablishing American military credibility. We should also make clear that foreign donors—the United States, the Europeans, the Japanese and Koreans, the Gulf states—will help rebuild the parts of Syria that Assad controls only when he allows the creation of these autonomous zones and establishes a process to step down from power. That process could take a while. In the interim, we could allow humanitarian aid but not large-scale development assistance to flow to areas still controlled by Assad. Russia and Iran and Hezbollah do not have the money to rebuild Syria, so our economic leverage is considerable.

Breneman January 1, 1994 Foreign assistance for this reconfigured Syrian state should be provided primarily to the autonomous regions themselves. That would enhance the international community’s leverage with the new, regional governments and allow us to bypass Assad. Many Syrians will not like the idea of a fragmented nation, or even of a central government controlling say half the country with the other half divided into three or four autonomous zones. But a new, coalition government presiding over a unified nation is not in the cards anytime soon. Moreover, such arrangements need not be permanent. The deal that ultimately codified the autonomous zones could include a provision that, 10 years hence, a constitutional convention would be held to consider whether a stronger central government should be restored. Trump’s use of cruise missiles was justifiable and useful, but now comes the more comple part. He needs to develop a broader strategy that envisions a Syria in which all groups have their rights and their protection, through some type of plan for self-governance in regions where Kurds and Sunni Arabs predominate. That might just work. Related Content Wanted: A strategy for stabilizing Syria Syria Wanted: A strategy for stabilizing Syria Michael E.

(Sebastian Gollnow/dpa via Reuters Connect) 6 min read Bluesky Streamline Icon: https://streamlinehq.com Bluesky Print With the fall of the Assad regime, Syrians now have the opportunity to build the future for which so many fought, died, and suffered over the past 13 years. Whether they will be able to do so is uncertain. Early indicators offer some basis for optimism , yet if Syria’s still-nascent transition is to succeed, a new government will need to move urgently to repair Syria’s devastated economy. Today, most Syrians live in desperate economic conditions. The United Nations reports that more than 90% of Syrians live in poverty, while the cost of living has tripled in the past three years. By 2017, when violence began to ebb, a third of the country’s housing stock had been destroyed , along with half of its medical and educational facilities and its power grid . In most of the country, electricity is available for only a few hours each day. For the new government to be seen as legitimate and worthy of support, Syrians will need to feel their economic conditions improving. They will need to see that an economic recovery is being managed not only efficiently, but fairly. Commenting just days after Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow, his former prime minister, Mohammed Ghazi Jalali, observed that “poverty and corruption led to the fall of the Syrian regime, not the 13-year war in the country.” Years of economic crisis and predatory rule by the Assad regime drained it of support and left it vulnerable to collapse. To avoid a renewed eruption of economic grievances that could easily destabilize a precarious transition, the interim government will need to persuade Syrians that they are better off, and have better prospects, than they did under Assad. Since the regime’s fall, discussions about how to assist Syria’s economic recovery have focused on sanctions relief. Selectively lifting sanctions on critical economic sectors and institutions, such as the oil sector and the Syrian Central Bank, should happen quickly, while sanctions on Assad regime figures complicit in war crimes remain in place. Unfortunately, quick action by either the United States, the European Union, or European governments is unlikely. All three are using sanctions as leverage to nudge the new Syrian administration toward an inclusive political transition that respects human rights. Following the first meeting between the French and German foreign ministers and their Syrian counterparts in Damascus, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, underscored the European position, telling reporters that Europe “will not be a financier of Islamist structures.” The Biden administration also shows little interest in quick action on sanctions. Beyond the Biden administration’s risk aversion, sanctions relief faces steep legal and bureaucratic hurdles. Most U.S. sanctions, including those intended to deter third-party trade and investment, are mandated by law . These include provisions of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act that were renewed on December 23 when President Joe Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Congress passed the NDAA on December 18, only days after the Assad regime collapsed, leaving too little time for Caesar provisions to be stripped from the bill. To rescind provisions of the Caesar act, or lift other sanctions passed by Congress over the past four decades, will require quick bipartisan action and the support of the incoming Trump administration. In the interim, the Biden administration has issued a general license that lifts some restrictions on trade and financial flows for si months. This is a welcome step. It will bring a measure of economic relief. Yet the license preserves sanctions on activities essential for reconstruction, including sweeping restrictions on “new investment .” And with sanctions still in place, a temporary general license may not be sufficient to overcome the legal concerns of banks and firms whose willingness to do business in Syria is critical for long-term recovery. The initial focus of the new Republican-controlled Congress will be on its domestic priorities. Yet congressional action to rescind the Caesar act should not be a heavy lift. In February 2024, the House passed a related bill , the Assad Regime Anti-Normalization Act, with a huge bipartisan majority of 389 votes. If the Trump administration supports legislative action to remove a major impediment to Syria’s economic recovery, Congress could readily act on a bill that would bolster prospects of a stable, sustainable, and legitimate transition in Syria. To remove sanctions in the face of serious concerns about how Syria’s new administration will govern is not without risks. Yet withholding sanctions relief as a source of leverage may prove far more costly. Without the economic relief that the removal of sanctions makes possible, the prospects for a sustainable, legitimate political transition will become even more uncertain. With spoilers seizing every opportunity to derail Syria’s fragile transition, deferring economic recovery is a recipe for chaos and discord. And while Western governments hold back on sanctions relief to assess its responsiveness, the administration in Damascus is no doubt doing the same, keeping its own balance sheet of how its appeals for relief are being received in Western capitals. After decades of sharp antagonism between the United States and the Assad regime, there is a fleeting window now, in the early phases of transition, to put U.S.-Syrian relations on a more positive footing, with potential long-term gains for Syrians, for regional security, and for the United States. To reject reasonable requests from Syria’s interim government for urgently needed relief will not only undermine the prospects for economic recovery—sustaining the conditions for mass Syrian immiseration—but also jeopardize opportunities for an improvement in U.S.-Syrian relations that the United States struggled but failed to secure during the Assad regime’s entire 54-year tenure. To grasp this opportunity will require the United States to be forthcoming on sanctions relief. The potential gains from doing so more than offset its possible risks.

Reuters/Ali Hashisho 8 min read Bluesky Streamline Icon: https://streamlinehq.com Bluesky Print According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are more than 29 million refugees worldwide under its mandate. Most of them are hosted in the countries of the Global South and find themselves in a protracted situation without access to a durable solution, such as voluntary return, resettlement, or local integration as defined by the UNHCR . Ne t week, the Global Refugee Forum will meet in Geneva for the second time to address this situation and to revitalize global solidarity vis-à-vis the countries that host them. The Global Refugee Forum was established in 2019 to monitor the implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR), adopted the previous year. The forum gathers representatives from governments, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and other entities to support the development of long-term, sustainable solutions to large movements of refugees. At the forum, stakeholders make voluntary pledges in the form of financial contributions, policy changes, specific programs or projects, and other types of support to improve the conditions of refugees and their host communities. The forum also provides an opportunity to explore innovative policy proposals. One such proposal has been made by the United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) under the title of the “Turkey Compact.” Its central idea is that in return for hosting large numbers of refugees and facilitating their access to formal employment, the countries of the Global North should grant these countries facilitated market access by concluding preferential trade agreements with them. This idea deserves greater policy attention because it promises to make long-term support for refugees and their host communities considerably more sustainable and effective. The Global Refugee Forum provides an ideal platform to do this. Economic inclusion for refugees An important consequence of the European migration crisis of 2015 and 2016 was the realization that the refugee protection regime based on the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees was “ broken ” and improving the economic inclusion of refugees could benefit both refugees as well as the development of their host communities . A growing body of research also shows that the proper employment prospects for refugees and a welcoming environment for their entrepreneurs contribute to economic growth in the host country. This research, moreover, demonstrates that the faster obstacles to formal employment are resolved, the sooner refugees integrate as productive members of their host society. Finally, this kind of positive integration also enhances the likelihood of refugees returning to their countries of origin and their ability to help with reconstruction there. This thinking is reflected in the GCR’s call to support the self-reliance of refugees and the resilience of host communities through, inter alia, the promotion of “economic opportunities, decent work, job creation and entrepreneurship programs for host community members and refugees” in countries hosting them. Four countries, Colombia , Jordan , Turkey , and Uganda , have at least on paper made efforts to facilitate access to work permits for refugees while many more countries legally allow refugees to enter their formal labor markets. Yet these measures have not always been very successful. Turkey and the limits of promoting economic inclusion Take the case of Turkey, which hosts 3.6 million refugees, the largest number in the world. In 2016, legislation was introduced that enables refugees, under certain conditions, to obtain work permits. However, very few refugees have been granted work permits; an estimated 800,000 to 1.1 million refugees, including women and children, participate in the informal labor market under particularly precarious conditions . Furthermore, in Turkey, considerable international funding has been channeled into projects to support refugees’ access to livelihood opportunities, emphasizing the acquisition of vocational and language skills. However, despite an ever-growing number of such projects, there has been neither a sizeable nor a sustainable increase in formal jobs for refugees. According to the “ Turkey: 3RP Country Chapter , ” the livelihood projects put only about “20,000 individuals into employment through job placement and job creation activities.” Another source put the number of jobs created through such projects from 2017 to 2024 at 66,000. Creating demand for refugee labor in Jordan One way to overcome the problem of transforming improved “employability” into sustained employment would be to create demand for refugee labor. The GCR suggests e ploring “preferential trade arrangements … especially for goods and sectors with high refugee participation” to spur employment both for refugees and locals, thereby helping social cohesion. This suggestion is fully in line with trade liberalization policies that call for the reduction of tariffs, the e pansion or even full elimination of quotas, and the resolution of regulatory obstacles, all of which are key drivers of economic growth and employment. Such economic growth would also help create demand for refugees’ skills and labor and complement ongoing efforts to increase their employability. So far, the EU-Jordan Compact is the only e ample of its kind. In this compact, the EU promised to provide easier market access for the products of Jordanian companies employing a minimum number of Syrian refugees, on the condition that the Jordanian government facilitate the acquisition of work permits for the refugees. However, the compact failed to reach its targets for various reasons , such as the lack of companies that fit the criteria, met EU e port standards, and were active in the product sectors listed in the compact. The Jordanian government’s remaining restrictions on the employment of foreign workers and its delays in issuing work permits, of which most were for short-lived cash-for-work programs rather than sustainable jobs, further contributed to the compact’s failure. In particular, refugee women have not been able to benefit from these efforts, with their employment level remaining especially low. In contrast, the UNDP’s Turkey Compact offers an actionable policy proposal on how to remedy these problems. The UNDP’s proposal deserves attention Last year, the UNDP commissioned a feasibility study that demonstrated how an e tension of trade preferences to Turkey by Canada, the EU, and the United States could incentivize businesses in the Turkish agricultural, processed food, and te tile sectors to generate sustainable employment for both Syrian refugees and locals. If implemented, this policy would help e pand Turkish e ports by an estimated $7.8 billion in 2025, create directly and indirectly 336,000 jobs, and add 0.82% of value to Turkey’s overall GDP. Like the EU-Jordan Compact, the Turkey Compact conditions Western countries’ trade liberalization on the increased formal employment of Syrian refugees in Turkish companies. This policy proposal is in line with the GCR’s call for a “whole society approach” that also incorporates the interests and needs of host communities while addressing the challenges of social cohesion. It would also be in line with the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and its commitment to “ leave no one behind .” In the longer run, this proposal could constitute a template for other countries, particularly in the Global South, that host many refugees by promoting agreements that take a developmental approach instead of focusing on migration control by means of pure border management. Finally, especially given the political atmosphere vis-à-vis refugees in EU member states today, win-win migration agreements that offer host countries tangible benefits in the form of sustainable job creation could become an effective way to uphold the Geneva Convention of 1951. The UNDP’s policy proposal of e tending trade preferences to spur sustainable employment for both refugees and locals deserves consideration at the upcoming Global Refugee Forum. It is an idea that offers win-win outcomes for refugees, their host countries, and donor countries, whose resources are increasingly stretched in a world that faces ever more natural and human-made disasters.

Key areas covered by the Banking and Corporate programme are:- Banks and non-bank intermediaries Financial stability, insurance and pension companies Bank supervision and regulation Financial markets and economic activity Risk management, monetary policy and central banking Behavioural corporate finance and financial intermediation Fintech, big data and machine learning Corporate governance, capital structure, dividend and payout structure Corporate control and going public Finance and labour Financial innovation, mergers and acquisitions While aiming to maintain the two strands of Financial Economics separate to the e tent possible, CEPR recognises that some researchers are active in areas relevant for BCF and AP programmes. For this reason, Fellows and Affiliates in the BCF programme will also receive calls for papers and other communications by the AP programme, for a time. Annual Symposia BCF Symposium The new BCF Symposium will take place annually from 2024. In 2023 the BCF Group will support the Bocconi - BAFFI CAREFIN - CEPR Workshop On Financial Intermediation and Corporate Finance . ESSFM – Corporate Finance Week Fellows and Affiliates in the BCF programme will meet annually at the European Summer Symposium in Financial Markets (ESSFM). Hosted by the Studienzentrum Gerzensee since 1991, ESSFM includes daily seminars in which participants present their work, as well as less formal seminars scheduled at the beginning of the Symposium. ESSFM is held over two weeks, one of which concentrates on some recent development in corporate finance. A substantial amount of time is reserved for independent work and collaborative research, which provides participants with a unique opportunity to interact and discuss each other's research. In addition, every Symposium features 'focus sessions', concentrating on the latest developments at the frontier within a specific area of research.

CEPR has a long history of promoting research in financial economics. The Financial Economics programme has recently split in two; Asset Pricing (AP) and Banking and Corporate Finance (BCF), to provide more targeted conferences and interactions. The key areas covered by the Asset Pricing programme are:- Capital markets, macro-finance, international finance, portfolio choice and individual investor decisions Asset management, information, and liquidity in asset markets Asset market frictions Limits to arbitrage and behavioural finance Machine learning and AI in asset markets While aiming to maintain the two strands of Financial Economics separate to the e tent possible, CEPR recognises that some researchers are active in areas relevant for AP and BCF programmes. For this reason, Fellows and Affiliates in the AP programme will also receive calls for papers and other communications by the BCF programme, for a time. Annual Symposia AP Symposium The new AP Symposium will take place annually in Paris. The Symposium is similar in spirit to the NBER Summer Institute, and it promotes high-quality research and facilitates interactions between Fellows and Affiliates in the AP Programme and researchers worldwide. Please keep an eye out for the first call for papers. ESSFM – Asset Pricing Week Fellows and Affiliates in the AP programme will meet annually at the European Summer Symposium in Financial Markets (ESSFM).

      "content": "Ale ander Joe/AFP via Getty Images en English Politics 0 The Scramble for Critical Minerals Jul 23, 2025 Rabah Arezki and Rick van der Ploeg Vast natural-resource endowments have proven to be more of a curse than a blessing, with resource-rich countries often developing more slowly than their resource-poor counterparts. Today, countries rich in critical minerals have a chance to change this – but only if they invest in strengthening their institutional capacity. PARIS – The world’s superpowers have developed a seemingly insatiable appetite for the critical minerals that are essential to the ongoing energy and digital transitions, including rare-earth metals (for semiconductors), cobalt (for batteries), and uranium (for nuclear reactors). The International Energy Agency forecasts that demand for these minerals will more than quadruple by 2040 for use in clean-energy technologies alone. But, in their race to control these vital resources, China, Europe, and the United States risk causing serious harm to the countries that possess them. As it stands, China is leading the pack, having gained ownership or control over an estimated 60-80% of the critical minerals that are needed for industry (such as for magnets) and the green transition. This control e tends across the supply chain: China is heavily invested in mining across Africa, Central Asia, and Latin America, and has been building up its processing capabilities. For Western powers, China’s quasi-monopoly over critical minerals looks like an economic and national-security threat. This fear is not unfounded. In December 2024, China restricted e ports of critical minerals to the US in retaliation for US restrictions on e ports of advanced microchips to China. Since then, US President Donald Trump has forced Ukraine to relinquish a significant share of its critical minerals to the US in what he presents as repayment for American support in its fight against Russia. Trump also wants US sovereignty over mineral-rich Greenland, to the dismay of Denmark. And he has suggested that Canada, with all its natural resources, become America’s 51st state. The European Union, for its part, has sought its own mining contracts, such as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), touted as the “Saudi Arabia of critical minerals.” From the Scramble for Africa in the nineteenth century to Western attempts to claim Middle Eastern oil in the twentieth, such resource grabs are hardly new. They reflect a fundamental asymmetry: less industrialized developing economies tend to consume fewer resources than they produce, whereas the opposite is true for developed economies – and, nowadays, China. In principle, this asymmetry creates ideal conditions for mutually beneficial agreements: industrialized economies get the resources they desire, and non-industrialized economies get a windfall, which they can use to bolster their own development. But, in reality, vast natural-resource endowments have proven to be more of a curse than a blessing, with resource-rich countries often developing more slowly than their resource-poor counterparts.

Subscribe Now A key reason for this is that developed economies have more economic clout, advanced technology, and military might – all of which they bring to bear to acquire the resources they seek. For e ample, European imperial powers used steam-engine technology to help them explore and e ploit Africa for resources like copper, tin, rubber, timber, diamonds, and gold in the nineteenth century. This, together with more advanced weaponry and other technologies, meant that, far from offering local communities fair compensation for their valuable resources, European powers could subjugate those communities and use their labor to e tract and transport what they wanted. But even countries that are e porting their resources for a profit have often struggled to make progress on development, not only because of imbalanced deals with more powerful resource importers, but also because their governments have often mismanaged the associated bonanzas. It does not help that resource-rich countries and regions often grapple with internal and e ternal conflicts. Consider the mineral-rich provinces of the DRC, such as Katanga and North Kivu, which have long suffered from violence and lawlessness, fueled by neighbors such as Rwanda and Uganda. Today, the advance of the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels is fueling bloodshed in eastern Congo – and creating an opportunity for outside powers to gain access to critical minerals. The DRC-Rwanda peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration promises precisely such access to the US, in e change for security guarantees. But the resource curse is not inescapable, especially for countries with strong outward-facing institutions to manage the economy’s e ternal relations, including its resource sector’s ability to attract investment and generate revenues for the state, and inward-facing institutions to govern how those revenues are used. If a country is to translate its resource endowments into economic development and improvements in human well-being, both have a critical role to play. Outward-facing institutions must negotiate fair and transparent mining contracts with multinational corporations and strengthen local governments’ ability to do the same. Such contracts should include local-content requirements, which keep more high-value-added processing activities at home, increase local employment, and strengthen the capacity of local suppliers and contractors. Since acquiring a 15% stake in De Beers, Botswana has sought to ensure that diamond cutting – not just mining – occurs domestically , which requires inward-facing institutions to deliver adequate investment in these capabilities. Inward-facing institutions must also manage risks raised by resource e traction, from health and environmental damage (deforestation, biodiversity loss, pollution) to labor-rights violations (including child labor). Unfortunately, as it stands, many mineral-rich countries are falling far short, leading some to advocate boycotts of critical minerals coming from conflict zones or countries using forced labor. While such boycotts are unlikely to sway these governments, they could convince multinationals and foreign governments to demand better enforcement of environmental and social standards from countries with which they do business. Ultimately, however, it is up to mineral-rich countries to defend their interests and make the most of their endowments. This starts with efforts to strengthen institutions.

The path forward lies in forging mutually beneficial partnerships that align climate objectives with the unique needs of emerging markets and developing economies. BRUSSELS/GENEVA/PARIS – Scientists have repeatedly warned us – with ever-growing intensity – that the planet is hurtling toward climate tipping points. Despite numerous international pledges, the evidence suggests that limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius is increasingly unlikely. If current trends persist, that threshold could be breached as early as 2028 . At the same time, biodiversity loss is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, with dire consequences for vulnerable communities and humanity at large. A stable climate and healthy ecosystems are ine tricably linked, implying the risk of cascading catastrophes. To be sure, there has been some progress on both fronts. The 2015 Paris agreement was the most ambitious and politically viable climate deal of its time. Based on a “pledge and review” model, it set an ambitious yet attainable target and introduced mechanisms to ensure broad participation, while establishing a framework for assessing national commitments against the shared goal. Then, in 2022, the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15) adopted the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, following a similar approach. While some major countries like India remained far behind , there was hope that they would eventually join as global momentum continued to build. That optimism was short-lived. On the very first day of his second term, US President Donald Trump signed an e ecutive order titled “ Unleashing American Energy ” and announced that the United States would once again withdraw from the Paris agreement, dismissing climate change as a “hoa .” Governments and civil society now face a fundamental challenge: developing viable strategies for achieving climate and biodiversity goals without US involvement.

Subscribe Now In a recent Bruegel-Center for Economic Policy Research report , we explore how this can be done. We begin with the recognition that while the US remains a major greenhouse-gas emitter, its policies alone are unlikely to determine the planet’s fate. The decisive battleground is now in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), which account for two-thirds of current emissions and are home to most of the world’s biodiversity. With their emissions rising rapidly, EMDEs must urgently shift to low-carbon, nature-positive growth. But they face formidable obstacles: massive investment needs, high capital costs, limited fiscal space, and pressing development priorities. Meaningful climate action will thus require mutually beneficial economic partnerships that align global emissions targets with EMDEs’ development needs. In our report, we identify four types of partnerships that could serve as pillars of a new cooperative framework. The first is a carbon pricing alliance, underpinned by a shared carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). While regulations and subsidies matter, carbon pricing is necessary to incentivize businesses and households to reduce their emissions. But without safeguards, it risks creating trade distortions by giving a competitive edge to countries that either don’t price carbon or set prices far below effective levels. That is the rationale for the European Union’s CBAM, which applies to only a handful of carbon-intensive products like steel and cement during its transitional phase. To address this challenge, we propose creating a climate coalition of developed and developing countries committed to a tiered carbon-price floor, based on income level. Members would benefit from mutual CBAM e emptions and gain access to financing, technology, and markets. The EU, for e ample, could collaborate with any country willing to set a meaningful carbon price, including the US – should it revise its current stance – and China. Many EMDEs still depend on emissions-intensive coal-fired power plants because they require far less capital investment than greener alternatives. The second pillar, therefore, is a climate-finance coalition dedicated to decarbonizing the power sector in these countries. Accelerating this shift will require closing the massive investment gap: annual clean-energy spending in developing countries must quadruple by 2030 to meet the Paris agreement’s targets. Compounding the challenge, the cost of capital in EMDEs is often twice as high as in advanced economies, making renewables appear artificially e pensive despite falling technology costs. We propose formal agreements in which developed economies provide climate financing in e change for EMDEs’ commitment to ambitious net-zero targets. The EU, China, Japan, and South Korea, for e ample, could fund EMDEs’ decarbonization efforts at an annual cost of less than 0.3% of their combined GDP – a modest investment relative to the climate damage such an agreement would help avert. The third pillar is a green industrial partnership between the EU, the United Kingdom, Norway, and selected countries in the Global South. Given its limited renewable-power potential, Europe will continue to rely on energy imports. But rather than shipping green electricity across oceans, it would be more efficient to relocate energy-intensive production to resource-rich EMDEs. European industrial policies currently favor energy-intensive sectors and subsidize their decarbonization. A smarter approach would be to support downstream, high-value industries while phasing out protections for uncompetitive upstream production. The fourth pillar is the creation of markets for carbon removal and nature protection. Reaching net-zero emissions implies net- negative emissions after 2050, yet carbon removal – whether technological or nature-based – remains underdeveloped, fragmented, and poorly incentivized. Two innovations could help establish these markets. One is the introduction of cleanup certificates, which would allow emitters to take on carbon debt and repay it in the form of verified future removals, financed at scale through market demand. Another potential solution is the creation of “nature shares” – a new class of financial asset designed to support long-term investment in biodiversity-rich regions. Unlike conventional carbon offsets, which are often plagued by credibility issues and short-termism, nature shares would offer a steady stream of carbon and biodiversity dividends, priced transparently and backed by robust public governance. These tools would enable markets to treat nature not as a liability, but as an asset. The EU is pivotal to advancing this agenda. With its mature carbon market and regulatory credibility, the bloc is well positioned to serve as the backbone of emerging international coalitions. To that end, it must accelerate its own emissions reductions, e pand the CBAM, and forge meaningful industrial partnerships. In a world approaching climate catastrophe, Europe has a rare opportunity to lead by e ample.

That is why Brazil’s COP30 presidency must eschew flashy results in favor of pragmatic pathways to deliver on past agreements. CAPE TOWN – In 2015, the landmark Paris climate agreement set the ambitious but necessary goal of limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and ensuring that the increase stays “well below” 2°C. With the average global surface temperature having already reached 1.1°C (1.98°F) above the twentieth-century baseline, time is running out to reach this goal. Yet governments have so far failed to agree on a strategy for doing so. At last month’s 62nd session of the United Nations Climate Change Subsidiary Bodies (SB62) in Bonn – the mid-year negotiations intended to lay the groundwork for November’s UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém – countries got so hung up on the details of the agenda that little progress was made. Such delays have long characterized the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, but they are at odds with scientific reality, which demands rapid and unified action. Building consensus is thus a key challenge facing Brazil’s COP30 presidency. The task ahead is formidable – not only because of the challenges inherent in the UNFCCC process, but also because four interconnected global developments are undermining trust and impeding multilateral cooperation. First, the global-governance architecture, with the UN at its core, is showing signs of disarray . Institutions that were designed to nurture and facilitate cooperation are increasingly hamstrung by bureaucratic inertia and outdated organizational structures. With reform efforts gridlocked , the UN system risks losing its relevance, and multilateralism its credibility. Second, the rise of transactional diplomacy has meant countries prioritize their own short-term interests over collective long-term needs. This approach – based on a narrow conception of national interest – effectively precludes broad-based cooperation, as it erodes the norms that have traditionally underpinned international engagement. Third, compromise is increasingly being rejected in favor of “ realism ,” leading to e treme polarization and entrenched negotiating positions. Multilateral negotiations regularly come down to the wire , and the results are often disappointing, further encouraging transactional engagement at the e pense of cooperation and compromise.

Subscribe Now Finally, climate change is increasingly taking a back seat to other challenges, with armed conflicts , a global trade slowdown , intensifying growth headwinds , and record debt levels consuming countries’ political attention, diplomatic space, and financial resources. Brazil clearly has its work cut out for it. Above all, it must resist the tendency for COP presidencies to emphasize fresh agreements and ambitious commitments – the kind that grab headlines and make the negotiations look like a smashing success but often fall short when the hard work of implementation begins. Brazil’s COP30 presidency must eschew flashy results in favor of pragmatic pathways to deliver on past commitments. Fortunately, Brazil recognizes this. Its Fourth Letter to the International Community outlines an Action Agenda aimed at making progress on what the world has “already collectively agreed” during previous COPs and in the Paris climate agreement. Specifically, the Agenda seeks to leverage existing initiatives to complete the implementation of the first “ global stocktake ” under the Paris agreement, which was concluded at COP28. This focus on previously agreed outcomes is well-suited to the current geopolitical conte t, in which any agreement can be difficult to reach. Representatives at the SB62 in Bonn did not achieve a consensus, and last month’s G7 summit failed to deliver a joint communiqué. Rather than perpetuating stalemates, the Action Agenda invites stakeholders to make progress where agreement already e ists. The Agenda also charts the way forward. It is organized into si thematic “a es,” including stewarding forests, oceans, and biodiversity; transforming agriculture and food systems; and building resilience for cities, infrastructure, and water. “Unleashing enablers and accelerators” in finance, technology, and capacity-building – the final, cross-cutting a is – will accelerate implementation at scale. Since responsibility for the implementation and governance of climate policy is distributed among many actors – which must have some level of trust that others are doing their part – the Agenda also establishes “transparency, monitoring, and accountability” as top priorities. To this end, Brazil’s COP30 presidency should seek to deliver a set of shared principles and supportive mechanisms. As COP30 Special Envoys, we e tend our full support to the Action Agenda. By emphasizing consolidation, rather than spectacle, Brazil is setting the stage for a highly productive COP30 – one focused on bridging divides, building trust, and delivering genuine progress. The task ahead is daunting, but the chance to rebuild momentum is real.

Four countries already have, with Indonesia the latest to do so – and possibly the first to regret it. https://prosyn.org/YSYU 2B To continue reading, register now. It’s free!

If they are to meet this potential, however, policymakers must get the fundamentals right. BRIDGETOWN – Every few years, a new idea captures the imagination of development experts and practitioners. Though often launched with noble intentions and great enthusiasm, many of these concepts fade quickly, leaving little lasting impact. Will the latest entrant – so-called country platforms – break this cycle and fulfill its promise? While there is no universally accepted definition of a country platform, the term typically refers to frameworks whereby developing countries take the lead in setting priorities for climate action and sustainable development, and coordinating with multilateral development banks (MDBs), donors, and the private sector to mobilize the necessary financing. It is a promising concept. But if country platforms are to avoid becoming just another fleeting development trend, they must begin to deliver tangible results quickly. Aligning diverse stakeholders is essential. But getting from alignment to impact depends on getting at least four imperatives right. The first priority is careful consideration of the respective roles of government and the private sector. Country platforms will likely depend heavily on public-private partnerships (PPPs), which are most effective when governments make strategic decisions about where private investment and e pertise can add the most value. Establishing strong risk-sharing frameworks and clearly defining the terms of engagement are also essential. The Philippines’ Public-Private Partnership Center, established in 2010, serves as a useful model. Operating under the guidance of the Department of Finance and the Department of Economy, Planning, and Development, the Center offers early-stage project-development support, clear policy direction, and a trusted platform for aligning government and investor interests. One key to the Center’s success was early engagement with chambers of commerce. Another was the reform of the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Law, which allowed unsolicited proposals to be considered, provided they underwent a competitive challenge. So, instead of the government prescribing a specific solution, the private sector proposed approaches that were aligned with national priorities and delivered the best value for money. The resulting partnerships allowed the government to optimize service delivery, taking advantage of private-sector efficiencies and innovation, on one hand, and the government’s administrative capacity, on the other. The result was $45 billion in financing mobilized over a decade – and the rapid transformation of the Philippines’ infrastructure.

Subscribe Now But country platforms e tend beyond PPPs, which may not be well suited to advance certain priorities – such as social-service delivery or some aspects of climate adaptation – especially in less-developed economies or post-conflict and post-disaster settings. In these cases, the public sector must be able to deliver. This brings us to the second imperative: clear and granular delegation of ownership for agenda implementation. After Hurricane Maria devastated the small island state of Dominica in 2017, the government passed the Climate Resilience Act and established the Climate Resilience E ecution Agency for Dominica (CREAD). Backed by just $5 million in donor funding for its initial four-year mandate, the agency was up and running within three months, with highly e perienced, motivated, and mostly local or regional staff in place. Despite this promising start, however, CREAD failed to live up to its potential in the first two years of its mandate, and insufficient ownership is a key reason why. Officially, CREAD was mandated to lead the development and delivery of an ambitious, home-grown resilience agenda. But in practice, it was not given the full authority it needed to do so. Perhaps the agency’s legal remit was considered too e pansive. Or maybe its fast-paced operating style was too much of a departure from the civil-service norm. Whatever the reason, CREAD was essentially relegated to the role of adviser, even on projects where its in-house procurement or construction e pertise could have been a game-changer. Moreover, CREAD had little choice but to support initiatives that had previously been approved by development partners, with predetermined scopes of work and implementation modalities. So, while the agency did leave some positive legacies – it is credited with developing Dominica’s Climate Resilience and Recovery Plan and building ministerial capacity – it was unable to complete the job for which it was created, causing its initial leadership team to resign. The broader lesson from both the Philippines and Dominica is that alignment of e ternal partners alone cannot deliver transformative change. If country platforms are to meet their potential, they must be truly nationally defined, mission-driven, whole-of-government-led mechanisms. And governments must be prepared to operate in new and possibly unconventional ways. Success depends on intention, ownership, and capacity, but even more so on incentives, which constitute the third imperative. For governments, e ternal incentives – like those used in the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative or the E tractive Industries Transparency Initiative – can help to drive progress. So can internal mechanisms, such as performance-based contracts for state-owned enterprises. Development partners, for their part, must understand that their role is to support governments in achieving their priorities, not to elevate priorities of their own. And they need incentives to act accordingly at all levels. For e ample, technical assistance or grants from MDBs and donors should be directed to support project pipeline development and the establishment of locally-led implementation frameworks that will remain in place for the long term. There must also be incentives for MDBs to collaborate, rather than compete, with one another. Country platforms stand a greater chance of gaining traction if they are tied to macroeconomic planning tools (such as medium-term spending frameworks and the IMF-World Bank debt-sustainability analyses) and other strategic financing instruments (such as debt-for-development swaps) – the fourth imperative. This would enable finance ministries to establish the platforms’ value from a broader macro-fiscal perspective, credibly demonstrating the benefits of increased concessional financing for growth and resilience initiatives and, by e tension, credit-rating improvements. While there is no silver bullet for development, country platforms can help advance comple investment agendas, particularly where institutional gaps in delivery or coordination are hampering progress, not least by identifying and backing the most effective projects. But good intentions and elegant frameworks will not produce these outcomes without strong public leadership, conte t-specific delivery models, and a relentless focus on outcomes.

Earlier this month, the company announced plans to resume sales of H20 chips to China . The less-advanced semiconductors, built on its Hopper architecture, are designed for artificial intelligence computing, but remain compliant with U.S. e port restrictions to China. However, a report in The Information suggested Nvidia is facing production delays in restarting H20 shipments to China. The report flags logistical setbacks, but Nvidia has already outlined a similiar timeline , indicating that revenue from these chips will likely be negligible until at least the fourth quarter. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, Piper Sandler, and Rosenblatt cite a mi of hurdles: e port licenses are still pending, previous orders were canceled , and Nvidia has little finished inventory. The company's supply chain also takes nine months to ramp. \"We would keep near-term expectations in check, given licenses have not yet been issued, and we see questions around available supply of H20 and whether RT chips (formerly B30/B40) will also be included, but it is a significant positive for 2026 for all AI stocks, including our Top Pick NVDA,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan wrote in a research note Sunday. NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia shares year to date Nvidia shares have risen 24% year to date, with a nearly 6% gain so far this month. To propel future gains, investor attention is likely to continue shifting toward Nvidia's next-gen Blackwell-based RT chips, potentially accelerating a move away from the older Hopper line. For now, the path to recovery in China is more about rebuilding momentum than generating near-term upside – with the potential for a more material revenue impact starting next year.",

To be sure, he anticipates AWS growth in the second quarter to reflect a slight deceleration from the first. \"Amazon's YTD commentary on AWS capacity constraints, plus recent competitor Cloud revenue acceleration has likely elevated Street focus on AWS,\" Post wrote in a Wednesday note to clients. \"We think 2Q Retail is setting up for a solid quarter, plus a strong 1Q for AWS backlog and accelerating quarterly AWS cape spending should drive accelerating 2H AWS growth.\" \"We think the most important commentary on the call will be 2H outlook for AWS growth (if provided), investors could become impatient on returns for ramping quarterly AWS cape spend given competitor acceleration,\" Post added. Looking ahead, the analyst said this year's longer Prime Day event and consumer resilience could drive a strong third-quarter outlook. Tariff uncertainty remains a key risk for the stock, he said. Amazon previously called out \"tariffs and trade policies\" and \"recessionary fears\" among several factors that could make its guidance subject to change. The tech giant topped earnings and revenue expectations for the first quarter, but had given light guidance for the second.",

Gangl joined \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday to offer his thoughts on the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies ahead of their quarterly earnings reports this week and next, as well other AI plays. Here are his takes during the \"Three-Stock Lunch\" segment. Alphabet The Google parent is a buy ahead of its earnings due Wednesday afternoon, the portfolio manager said. The stock has rallied more than 8% this month, but it remains a laggard for the year. Alphabet has gained 1% in 2025, while the S & P 500 has climbed more than 7%. What's more, Gangl said, Alphabet is the cheapest of the Magnificent 7 stocks, and cheaper than the overall market. \"This is a name we like here, especially on the sell-off earlier in the year,\" Gangl said. \"Stock's starting to catch up.\" Amazon The online retail giant, which reports quarterly earnings next Thursday, is a \"strong buy\" here, Gangl said. Shares have gained 3.7% year to date. Amazon is trading at a 31 times forward multiple, making the stock the \"cheapest that it's been in a decade,\" according to the portfolio manager. The internet company is posting strong growth in Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing services platform, while its retail business is also demonstrating resilience in the face of tariffs. \"Consumers are relatively strong.

They love to spend, and Amazon is the place they'll go to.\" Quanta Services Quanta Services is a buying opportunity, Gangl said. The stock has risen 25% year to date, but the company, which builds and maintains electric power grids, remains a major way to play the artificial intelligence theme. \"This is a player we like,\" Gangl said. \"It's not a cheap stock, trading at 33 times forward, but we think they're in the right place, right time.\"",

      "content": "Yields brokerage firms are willing to pay on idle cash are e pected to cool in the second half of this year, but a few companies are still offering attractive rates for now. The Federal Reserve hasn't made any movement on interest rate cuts since last December, maintaining its target interest rate range at 4.25% to 4.5%. Central bank policymakers are widely e pected to stand pat at the conclusion of their July meeting next Wednesday, too. Nevertheless, brokerages have been busy as of late, pulling back their cash sweep rates – the yields they pay on dollars that haven't yet been deployed into investments. Earlier this year, Raymond James Financial trimmed its rates by five to 25 basis points, depending on the amount of cash a client has, according to an analysis by Bank of America. Those with a relationship cash value of less than $250,000 can get 0.15% APY on their idle funds, while the largest accounts – those with $10 million or above in cash balances – can pick up 2.28%. Bank of America e pects those rates to continue sliding, particularly once the Fed resumes its cuts. \"Currently, the market is pricing in 2-3 cuts this year and an additional 2-3 cuts next year,\" wrote Craig Siegenthaler, Bank of America analyst, in a recent report. \"This implies that we will see much more activity on cash sweep rates over the next 12 months.\" Falling cash sweep rates encourage investors to put their idle cash to work. Further, lower yields on sweeps dampen the effect Fed rate cuts have on brokers' net interest margin and net interest income, Siegenthaler said. Higher rates in select places Despite the the shift, a few places are still offering solid yields. For now, eToro offers an annual percentage yield of 3.9% in its High Interest Cash Program . The brokerage earlier this year cut its rate from 4.15%, Bank of America's analysis found. Vanguard's Cash Plus Account is offering a yield of 3.65%, which reflects a 25 basis point cut the firm made earlier this year. The coveted 4% APY, which has become hard to find as brokerages reduce rates, is still out there, too. Robinhood Gold members can earn 4% yields on their uninvested cash , as can clients who have accounts managed by Robinhood Strategies, the firm's investment advisory service. Be aware that brokerage firms can cut their rates at any time, though. Further, these yields aren't enough to keep up with inflation over time. Investors who want to lock in attractive yields – and who don't mind reduced access to their cash – might be better off in a certificate of deposit . Popular Direct offers a 12-month CD with a yield of 4.3%, while Bread Financial has a similar CD with a rate of 4%.",

      "content": "The growth trade has gone almost parabolic since the April lows with a 40% rise in less than four months. I think we're in a secular bull market and should be considerably higher one year from now. Near term, however, I also think a pullback is possible. Should you care? I don't know. It depends on your perspectives and objectives. But if a 5% pullback is something you consider actionable, then a hedge in the Nasdaq might make sense. One investor's bull market is another investor's bear market. Trading and investing is all about your own personal perspectives and objectives. There is not one proper way to invest and speculate in the markets. You have to decide what best meets your objectives. If you're not sure how to answer those questions, please consult a financial advisor. It doesn't make you ignorant. We have actual scientists as clients - much smarter than I - who need help answering those questions. We're trained for this. Looking at the Invesco QQQ Trust , which tracks the Nasdaq-100, you'll see a sharp rise from the April lows. The Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) put in a commensurate rise with the QQQ price through May. In June, QQQ broke through the former $540 double top resistance level, which is now acting as support and a target level should the pullback I'm about to describe starts to manifest. However, when the $540 ceiling was being penetrated, the RSI did not confirm with a push to new highs indicating that momentum, or rate-of-change, was waning. Think of a ball being thrown in the air. Towards the ape of the throw the ball continues to move higher, but at a slowing rate of change until the direction changes and gravity takes over. In my short-term Active Opps model for our more active clients, I plan to bring in a short hedge via the ProShares Ultrashort QQQ ETF (QID) to protect gains in our core holdings. QID is trading around $24.61 and will look to e it the trade at a loss if it trades below $24.25. Remember, as QQQ goes up the QID goes down. Wednesday kicks off the heart of megacap growth earnings with Alphabet, ServiceNow and Tesla reporting. It gets busier next week with more earnings and next Federal Reserve meeting. Looking at some other macro markets with a potential impact on the stock market, I'm seeing gold (left chart) threatening a break through $317 resistance and the 20 year+ treasury bond ETF TLT acting a little 'bottomish' with a possible inverse head and shoulders with attendant RSI divergence. Gold and bond moving higher here is a cause for concern. Some profit taking before the real heart of earnings season after a historic 40% run in less than four months seems reasonable and relevant to our shorter-term managed model Active Opps. In the bigger, longer-time frame portfolios we managed, this possible pullback is noise and not something to be bothered with. I believe we're still in a secular AI-driven technology bull market that should be significantly higher one year from now. -Todd Gordon, Founder of Inside Edge Capital, LLC We offer active portfolio management and regular subscriber updates like the idea presented above .

I think that's going way higher.\" the firm's CEO said on CNBC's \" Halftime Report \" on Tuesday, referring to Interactive Brokers. \"Just looking at the way Schwab and Robinhood have been treated, I think that stock should get a bigger rally. And there are tons of those stories everywhere I look in the sector, so I think it's going to continue to work. I think you want to be in financials into end of the year,\" Brown added. Shares of the electronic broker are up more than 40% in 2025, as investors have grown optimistic on the company's e posure to a wide range of currencies and strong trading volumes seen this year. Interactive Brokers has also benefited from hopes that the Trump administration's deregulation push will be a boon for the financial sector, which is up about 9% year to date. Peers Charles Schwab and Robinhood, which Brown mentioned, have rallied about 29% and 175% this year, respectively. While deregulation is not a catalyst for any specific financial stock, it is a tailwind for growth in the sector, Brown said. He said he thinks financials can do even better given the growth of multimillionaire households, middle-class consumer spending and \"e plosive growth\" in individuals' 401(k) retirement account balances. \"The deregulation story is like the climate,\" Brown said. \"It e ists, and it's a different climate than what we e perienced over the previous four years. And it probably, in the background, has helped people feel a little bit better about buying some of these wealth managers, asset managers, money center banks at an elevated price-to-book over what they would have paid five years ago when they were being regulated like utilities. So now, there's a little bit more slack in the reins.\" Analysts covering Interactive Brokers have an average price target on the stock that implies nearly 6% potential upside ahead, per LSEG.

      "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/22/the-buzz-around-ai-neoclouds-is-growing-but-investors-should-tread-carefully.html",
      "source": "CNBC-Economy",
      "content": "Investors are raving about \"neoclouds\" and what their emergence means for the artificial intelligence boom. However, some warning signs are starting to flash. Neoclouds are companies specializing in AI cloud computing. Unlike traditional hyperscalers such as Amazon and Microsoft, these bespoke companies are viewed as attractive alternatives as they install and manage AI hardware and software in a faster and more tailored, cost-effective and potentially more energy-efficient way for clients. CoreWeave , which had its IPO in late March, is the largest publicly traded neocloud. Nebius is an up-and-coming name. A swath of private neocloud companies such as Lambda and Crusoe are attracting venture capital funding and working on high-profile AI contracts. Nvidia has taken an interest in these AI-native cloud startups as well. The chipmaking giant has increased its investments in CoreWeave and neocloud startups while also developing its own cloud business amid increasing hyperscaler competition. But while analysts like the niche neocloud model and their market share potential in the scaling AI cloud market, worries about their longer-term outlook are beginning to crop up. Risks they see are in these companies' high levels of cape spending, lack of differentiation and overall lofty AI valuations. UBS Global Wealth Management strategist Sundeep Gantori views neoclouds as a high-risk, potentially high-reward investment. \"Last year, [neoclouds] were very small, but now it's something that you cannot ignore in terms of size. Obviously, the revenues from those companies are not on par with the capital spending that they're doing,\" Gantori told CNBC. The problem, however, is these companies are spending so much on cape that it hurts their margins, he said. \"They're spending much more, but it's probably an investment into the future,\" Gantori added. UBS e pects AI cape beyond the big four tech giants — Amazon , Microsoft , Meta Platforms and Alphabet — to grow 85% year over year and hit $150 billion in 2025. That latter estimate includes robust spending from China, neoclouds and other hyperscalers and enterprise and sovereign cloud providers. Looking at overall market opportunity, Goldman Sachs takes a longer point of view on the technology. The firm estimates the total addressable market of the GPU-as-a-Service and AI cloud market by 2030 will be roughly $267 billion — with neoclouds comprising 20% share and hyperscalers 80%. Close ties between Nvidia and neoclouds appear risky Nvidia has strategically backed neoclouds CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe Energy and Nebius — a move that has popularized the space while boosting the chipmaker's own business amid increasing hyperscaler competition. Some analysts question the ultimate cost of this relationship. \"Nvidia has helped the rapid growth of several new GPU-focused clouds by directly investing in them, providing them large allocations of GPUs and publicity by various means,\" HSBC analyst Abhishek Shukla said in a Thursday note. \"Having a large number of GPU-focused cloud providers improves the competitive position of Nvidia, as the margin that the cloud providers can charge declines and a bigger share of the value is captured by Nvidia and the end-customer.\" Shukla is concerned about a couple of key financial risks neoclouds face, namely that they already generate low returns from their investments and could see declining pricing power as more GPUs become available. More importantly, he believes neoclouds could lose their business if hyperscaler customers eventually source GPUs directly from Nvidia. For e ample, Shukla said that CoreWeave may only see business from Microsoft as long as there is a shortage of GPUs and as long as Nvidia favors CoreWeave while it allocates new GPUs. \"Once this phase is over, Microsoft could purchase GPUs directly from Nvidia ... we see significant risk of key customers Microsoft and Open AI disintermediating CoreWeave and dealing directly with Nvidia,\" he said. \"We assess that more than 50% of debt financing available to CoreWeave is offered by OEMs (includes Nvidia). In our opinion, Nvidia benefits from this arrangement only if CoreWeave is leasing its GPUs to customers and creating more competition in the GPU leasing market, which helps Nvidia,\" Shukla said. Neoclouds remain a substantial part of Nvidia's longer-term growth opportunity. According to some analysts, Nvidia powering neoclouds, along with its own DG platform for AI development, allows the company to generate revenue from large-scale AI inference workloads and not just its GPUs. \"NVDA has shifted its strategic posture with regard to Neoclouds materially the last nine months and that they now view them as their de-facto data center arm,\" Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah wrote in a recent note, adding that \"NVDA's \"invigorated\" Neocloud strategy is dovetailing into an inferencing strategy.\" Wall Street views on top neoclouds Cloud infrastructure companies CoreWeave and Nebius are the key neocloud players in the market right now. Europe-based Nebius appears to be the better-liked play of the two. The company has four buy ratings from Wall Street analysts covering the name, according to LSEG, and was recently brought into the limelight by a bullish rating from Goldman Sachs analyst Ale ander Duval. Duval initiated coverage of Nebius with a buy rating and 12-month price target of $68, which implies 25% upside. \"Our rating reflects our more-positive-than-consensus view on the growth of the AI Neocloud market, as the Generative AI market continues to e pand rapidly and AI startups/enterprises seek specialized capacity alongside that provided by hyperscalers,\" Duval said in a July 14 note to clients. Duval said Nebius stands to benefit from capital allocation from future funding rounds, more customers and capacity e pansion driving revenue and asset utilization, as well as deals with large AI labs and companies improving GPU utilization. \"We see Nebius as especially well-positioned in light of its full stack software offering, cost advantages and demonstrable e pertise at scale,\" he said. CoreWeave is the largest publicly traded neocloud by market cap, meanwhile, with a valuation of more than $62 billion. Interest in CoreWeave is still high, but the AI stock's frothy valuation has garnered speculation on how far the stock can really go. Shares have skyrocketed more than 200% since the company's public market debut in the spring. However, the stock has tumbled 30% in the past month. CoreWeave's recent slide came after the company announced plans to acquire data center infrastructure company and longtime partner Core Scientific in an all-stock transition worth roughly $9 billion. The deal could serve as a major test to how Wall Street views parts of the AI glitz and glamour. Worries about the transaction being in stock, and about CoreWeave's sky-high valuation have been a drag on both stocks. On top of that, the consensus price target of $93.71 implies shares could decline nearly 27%, LSEG data shows. CRWV 1Y mountain CoreWeave stock performance over the past year. HSBC's Shukla initiated the stock with a reduce rating and $32 price target, saying CoreWeave shares are significantly overvalued. Shukla noted that CoreWeave's revenue comes primarily from Microsoft and Open AI, who use their own software, which he said \"dilutes CRWV's value proposition.\" CoreWeave's liquidity looks stretched and, moreover, the company faces a high cost of borrowing, he added. \"Compared with the likes of Microsoft, AI model providers have lower liquidity and weaker credit profiles, which creates its own set of challenges,\" Shukla wrote in a note to clients. \"CoreWeave's main business of leasing GPUs is getting commoditized and offers inferior returns.\" Mizuho Securities and Stifel each downgraded CoreWeave to hold earlier this month, while Citigroup on July 8 placed a downside catalyst watch on the stock. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino, who in early June initiated CoreWeave with a hold rating and 12-month target price of $180, shares concerns about the stock's valuation. However, Zino anticipates upside to CoreWeave's bookings as the company's customer base broadens and inference demand grows. He likes CoreWeave's revenue backlog, which he said offers multi-year visibility, and estimates CoreWeave will boast an operating profit in 2026. \"We're very positive in terms of the near-term outlook on a stock, but we just think that there are better, more affordable ways from a valuation perspective to play the overarching theme of compute,\" Zino told CNBC. \"Some neoclouds look good for now, but there are definitely storm clouds that you could potentially see in the future.\" The neocloud universe includes a slew of private AI infrastructure startups, including Lambda, Covalent and Crusoe Energy. Crusoe, which uses flare gas to build data centers, was tapped by Oracle in March to build a data center campus in Te as for Open AI's $500 billion Stargate project, with buildings e pected to eventually include 400,000 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs across the campus. Crusoe pivoted its business to AI from crypto as CoreWeave did. Lambda, which provides Nvidia GPUs at competitive rates, provides cloud services and software for training and deploying AI models.",

      "content": "Google parent Alphabet is among the first of the \" Magnificent Seven \" companies to report second-quarter earnings, with results due after the stock market closes on Wednesday. Shares of Alphabet have barely budged this year, lagging the other Magnificent 7 stocks and the S & P 500 . Investor concern is focused on the shifting search and advertising landscape, given the rise of artificial intelligence chatbots that risk Google's competitive edge. Still, analysts are generally bullish on Google's search and ad monetization for the second quarter. Wall Street is e pecting the YouTube owner to post double-digit earnings and revenue growth, according to LSEG. Analysts e pect Alphabet to report earnings of $2.18 per share, up 15.5% year over year, on revenue of $93.94 billion, up 10.9%. Investors may be worrying unnecessarily, however, based on history. Alphabet earnings have beaten expectations for nine straight quarters, according to Bespoke Investment Group, and the stock tends to rise an average of 1.3% in the first session after results are announced. Here's what Wall Street is e pecting from Alphabet results: Goldman Sachs: buy rating and $225 price target Analyst Eric Sheridan called out investor uncertainty toward Google's search business given the rise of consumer AI apps, and a lack of clarity around the Department of Justice's antitrust case against Google. Still, he remains bullish on the company's transformation toward being an \"answer engine\" rather than just a search engine. \"We continue to highlight GOOGL as one of the most compelling risk/reward skews (based on our upside/downside work) from current levels,\" Sheridan wrote in a July 10 note. \"We continue to view GOOGL's ability to distribute AI solutions (Gemini being at the center) across an array of existing desktop/mobile computing applications (Gmail, Search, Chrome, Drive, Maps, YouTube, Photos) as underappreciated.\" BMO Capital Markets: outperform, price target raised $8 to $208 Analyst Brian Pitz reintroduced Alphabet as a \"top pick,\" highlighting that its shares are selling for 18 times the company's e pected earnings over the next 12 months, below an average multiple of 22 times over the past five years. Pitz said a growing AI user base for Google's search business will lead to higher returns on advertising. \"As AI monetization continues to evolve, we believe Google will increasingly leverage its over twenty years of AI initiatives to continue e panding [return on ad spend] for its advertisers,\" he said, highlighting that YouTube is also integrating \"AI Overviews\" in its search results, which could increase engagement. Bank of America: buy, price target up $10 to $210 Analyst Justin Post raised his estimates and e pects strong results. \"2Q positives could include: 1) Commentary suggesting ad spend has accelerated since April, 2) Strong search results suggesting AI integration aiding monetization (lowering revenue reset risk), 3) YouTube beat on easy y/y comps, and 4) Cloud strength from added capacity & Workspace AI integration,\" Post said in a July 18 note. JPMorgan: overweight, $200 price target Analyst Doug Anmuth said Google \"continues to move fast in AI\" and rates the stock overweight. His price target implies about 5% potential upside from Monday's close. \"Positive into the print as our GOOGL checks were positive around Search, YouTube & Cloud while Google's AI innovations continue to impress,\" Anmuth wrote in a note to clients. \"AI & Cloud investments, esp. depreciation (JPMe +46% Y/Y to $5.4B), will weigh on margins (JPMe GAAP OIM -140bps Y/Y to 31%), but continued durable re-engineering of cost base needs to provide offset.\" Deutsche Bank: buy, $200 price target Analyst Benjamin Black believes Alphabet shares have room to appreciate at the same time as he acknowledged the lackluster performance against online advertising peers and the stock lagging the market since first-quarter results were released. \"Sentiment continues to weigh negatively on Google on concerns around share loss at Search long term, as statcounter estimates 14bps of share loss globally since the end of March,\" Black wrote in a July 14 note to clients. \"That said, our ad checks indicate that near-term revenue trends accelerated in the 2Q … and we slightly increase our 2Q Search estimate to account for favorable F tailwinds to 9% y/y (7% F N), slightly above the street.\" UBS: neutral, price target raised $6 to $192 UBS lifted its price target to $192, still suggesting limited upside from where Alphabet closed Monday. The bank increased its 2025 and 2026 revenue forecast, partly due to an improvement in the advertising environment. \"We remain Neutral weighted given mid-term uncertainty from regulatory outcomes (Search case remedy due August), limited resolution on impact from AI Overviews integration with more signs emerging that click through rates are down, and ongoing pressure from GenAI Search competitors with ChatGPT still gaining usage share,\" analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a July 16 note.",

The bank upgraded shares of the motorsport stock to a buy rating from hold. Analyst Stephen Laszczyk's price target of $120 represents a potential upside of 17% from the stock's Monday closing price. Shares of Liberty Formula One have rallied 12% this year. FWONK YTD mountain FWONK YTD chart In the Monday note, Laszczyk said the company has a lot going for it. \"High quality, e ecution based growth story with potential for outsized capital returns,\" he wrote. \"We believe that Liberty Formula One, through its ownership of both Formula 1 and MotoGP racing leagues, offers investors a high quality way to gain e posure to the long-term secular growth trends in sports media as well as what we believe will become a strong capital returns story within media & entertainment.\" One of Liberty's big opportunities stems from the potential to deleverage its balance sheet over the next several years. \"Our base case assumes that Liberty Formula One will maintain leverage at 2.5 by returning capital to shareholders via share repurchases,\" Laszczyk continued. \"Under this scenario, we estimate that Liberty Formula One could return $6.2B to shareholders by 2030E, or ~25% of current market capitalization.\" Meanwhile, the analyst also sees upside to analyst consensus for Formula 1, writing that the Street seems to be underestimating the potential for increased monetization in the sponsorship category. This opportunity for Formula 1 to grow revenue faster than consensus expectations could last through 2028. Another catalyst comes from opportunity for growth at MotoGP, the foundation for Grand Pri motorcycle racing. Laszczyk believes Liberty could similarly meaningfully grow revenue in the medium to long term following a period of repositioning and investment. \"In our view, similar to how Liberty took 2+ years to start building momentum with partners for F1, we e pect the MotoGP's growth story to play out over the medium-to-long term rather than provide a near-term catalyst for segment growth,\" he wrote. \"MotoGP's clearest path for e ecution against improving race monetization will be via the globalization and possible e pansion of its race calendar.\"",

      "content": "This week, I'm once again using a debit spread for my trade on GLD — but with a different approach to identifying the setup. At times, stocks enter a prolonged sideways grind — a phase where price action stalls and volatility dries up. These periods of consolidation can drag on for weeks or even months, testing a trader's patience. And sometimes, the best move during these phases is no move at all — sitting in cash and waiting for cleaner setups to emerge. But these quiet stretches don't last forever. What traders call a \"squeeze\" often develops during low-volatility conditions — where Bollinger Bands, a volatility-based indicator, contract tightly and get caught inside the Keltner Channels, another volatility tool. This compression signals that a breakout may be coming. Once price finally escapes this squeeze zone, it can trigger sharp, e plosive moves — and that's where the real opportunity lies. A popular technical indicator available on most platforms makes your life easy by catching these \"squeezes\" and even the breakouts. This is how it works: When a stock enters a low-volatility or sideways consolidation phase, the TTM Squeeze indicator begins plotting red dots on the chart. These red dots signal that the stock is in a \"squeeze\" — a period where price is coiling up. During this phase, it's usually best to stay on the sidelines, as clean directional moves are unlikely. A breakout from this squeeze is marked when those red dots turn green. That's your early heads-up that volatility is starting to return. Now, pair that with the momentum histogram: If the bars are blue, it often points to a bullish breakout. If the bars are red, it may suggest a bearish breakdown. In the case of GLD, we're still in that red-dot waiting phase — meaning the squeeze is in play, and we're watching for confirmation. Once green dots begin to show up, it tells us that volatility is e panding again and a directional move could be setting up. One key rule: wait for at least three consecutive momentum bars in the same direction before pulling the trigger. False breakouts are common, and this filter helps increase your odds of catching the real move. The Trade Setup: GLD Bull Call Spread Since GLD hasn't broken out of its squeeze just yet, we're in wait-and-watch mode for now. But if it does break out in the next few days and starts trading around $315, I'll be looking to initiate a bull call spread — a simple, defined-risk options setup. Here's the trade I'd consider: Buy $315 call, Aug 15 e piry Sell $316 call, Aug 15 e piry Cost: $50 Potential Profit: $50 If GLD climbs to $316 or higher by e piration, this setup would yield a 100% return on the amount risked. Scaling the trade with 50 contracts, for e ample, means risking $2,500 for the chance to make $2,500. As GLD continues to trend higher, traders can ladder into additional spreads — gradually building the position and increasing e posure while still keeping risk tightly managed. -Nishant Pant Founder: https://tradinge tremes.com Author: Mean Reversion Trading Youtube, : @TheMeanTrader DISCLOSURES: None.

It also included an e pected charge of €700mn mainly as a result of impairments on its Maserati vehicle platform. “Certainly the management team is not happy with where we’re at and we’re going to continue to progress in the second half,” Stellantis chief financial officer Doug Ostermann said in a briefing to investors on Monday. Stellantis is navigating a period of upheaval after the sudden departure of chief e ecutive Carlos Tavares in December following a sharp deterioration in financial performance. The world’s fourth-largest carmaker has faced rising inventory in the US, political tensions in its historic bases of Italy and France and weak vehicle demand in Europe. Stellantis is not alone in reporting deteriorating results in recent weeks. French carmaker Renault this month issued a profit warning due to weak demand in Europe, while Volvo Cars also reported its first operating loss since its 2021 listing as it warned of smaller profits from two critical vehicle models as a result of Trump’s car tariffs. Filosa, who was appointed chief e ecutive in May, is looking to continue with a turnaround effort started under the interim leadership of chair John Elkann, who remains as chair. Stellantis was one of several carmakers to pull its guidance earlier this year due to trade uncertainty caused by the tariffs, as Trump announced a 25 per cent levy on foreign-made vehicles and parts in March, and then proposed “reciprocal” tariffs on almost all trade. The group has been grappling with sluggish demand in Europe’s van business. “My own view and I think what we hear from clients is that there’s a lot of uncertainty in the environment today, both economic uncertainty and a lot of regulatory uncertainty,” Ostermann said. That has caused commercial customers to hang on to their fleets for a longer period, he added. Stellantis on Monday said it had released preliminary financial figures ahead of its first-half results e pected next week “to address the difference” between its performance and analysts’ forecasts, in the absence of financial guidance. Analysts said the company was better positioned than other carmakers in terms of tariff e posure because of its high level of local production in the US as well as compliance with a trade deal with Me ico and Canada that protects the group from higher tariffs. The company had previously warned of a net tariff impact of up to €1.5bn for the full year. Bernstein analyst Stephen Reitman said the large restructuring charge suggested that “the board is taking decisive steps” and would help with operating margins in the future. Carmakers have benefited from a recent rela ation of the EU’s tough regulations to reduce carbon emissions. But Jean-Philippe Imparato, the European head of Stellantis, has warned that it still faces the risk of a €2.6bn fine due to its light commercial vehicle business, which has been much slower to transition to electric vehicles. The company’s shares were trading down 2 per cent on Monday.

      "content": "JPMorgan Chase may still be positioned for more gains in 2025 despite its impressive year-to-date run, according to Eddie Ghabour of Key Advisors Wealth Management. The firm's co-founder and CEO joined CNBC's \" Power Lunch \" on Monday to offer his take on the stock, as well as a pair of other market movers. Here is what Ghabour said during the \"Three-Stock Lunch\" segment. JPMorgan Chase Shares of JPMorgan Chase have already rallied 22% this year, with the big bank's trading desk benefiting from an especially volatile market lately. On Monday, CNBC reported that JPMorgan was overhauling the leadership of its internal quantum computing research group and had poached an e ecutive from State Street. Despite this impressive year-to-date runup, Ghabour believes that there's further upside ahead, and remains a buyer of the stock at this time. \"We think the environment over the next 12 months is going to be a perfect storm for a bull market in financials, and JPMorgan has one of the best CEOs on the planet. And we think the market still has 20% more upside, which means their wealth management side — the revenue is also going to increase,\" he said. \"So deregulation, ta cuts and the economy reaccelerating and booming over the next 12 months is going to bode real well for this name.\" Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund Ghabour also voiced his support for the broader materials sector, specifically in the form of the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund ( LB) . Shares of the e change-traded fund have popped 8% in 2025. As a catalyst for the sector, Ghabour pointed to an e pected increase in defense spending that could drive upside in the stocks over the next 12 months. Members of NATO recently pledged to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense, up from 2% previously. \"So that's going to do really well for this sector,\" he said. General Motors On the other hand, Ghabour was not a fan of General Motors . The automaker will report its second-quarter earnings before the opening bell on Tuesday. Shares of General Motors were trading slightly higher on Monday after Benchmark Equity Research initiated coverage of the stock at a buy rating. Analyst Mickey Legg said that the automaker offered \"underappreciated upside\" and had a \"notably more disciplined\" electric vehicle strategy than its peers. But Ghabour disagreed with this take. He said he e pects GM will struggle in the EV space, particularly in the Chinese market. \"There are more and more people getting into the marketplace at lower price points, so we think they're going to continue to be challenged,\" he said. \"The other problem is we're worried about the consumer maybe frontloading car sales in the first quarter to get ahead of tariffs, so that could hurt their sales here in the second quarter.\" Shares of General Motors are trading fractionally higher on a year-to-date basis.",

      "content": "Bond investors still have one of the most attractive entry points in decades to generate portfolio income, according to Vanguard. Though off their highs of the year, yields have remained elevated across the Treasury and credit markets. The 10-year Treasury yield is currently around 4.4% and the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) , which provides broad e posure to the ta able investment-grade U.S. market, has a 30-day SEC yield of 4.39%. Bond yields move inversely to prices. BND YTD mountain Vanguard Total Bond ETF year to date Fi ed income has also been a stabilizer to portfolio performance this year thanks to their higher starting yields, the firm said a recently released third-quarter outlook. \"Higher income returns have helped provide a cushion against recent market volatility, keeping bond returns steady amidst larger swings in equities,\" the report said. Finding opportunity Vanguard sees opportunities across sectors. Within Treasurys, the firm e pects a range-bound environment and prefers holding duration e posure in the belly of the yield curve. When it comes to credit, investment-grade corporates and other high-quality credits offer the most compelling risk-adjusted returns, Colleen Cunniffe, Vanguard's head of global ta able credit research, told CNBC. \"Investment-grade corporates remain fundamentally sound, with resilient margins, agile supply chains, and steady productivity gains helping them weather recent tariff noise,\" she wrote in an . The Vanguard Total Corporate Bond ETF (VTC) currently has a 5.09% 30-day SEC yield and a 0.03% e pense ratio. VTC YTD mountain Vanguard Total Corporate Bond ETF year to date Within the segment, Cunniffe likes short-dated financials for their relative value. Banks are also fundamentally sound since they are well-capitalized with conservative liquidity needs, she added. In addition, Vanguard is overweight BBB-rated industrial issuers. Cunniffe's team also favors utilities within the investment-grade space thanks to their stable cash-flow profiles and strong demand for electricity from the rise of artificial intelligence. \"This demand has prompted increased capital investment, leading to more bond issuance and, in turn, more appealing valuations,\" she said. Outside of corporate bonds, Vanguard sees opportunities right now in mortgage-backed securities. While spreads in the bond market have fallen near some of its lowest levels in decades, MBS spreads have been higher than relative to history — which makes their pricing closer to fair value, Cunniffe said. \"There are several pockets of the market that offer attractive return potential with more limited prepayment risk, including agency-backed collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), agency-backed specified pools, agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, and non-agency but still high-quality AAA-rated residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS),\" she said. The Vanguard Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF (VMBS) has a 30-day SEC yield of 4.21% and a 0.03% e pense ratio. VMBS YTD mountain Vanguard Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF year to date. Lastly, Vanguard is overweight asset-backed securities (ABS), preferring higher-quality issuers and sectors that have proven track records though multiple economic cycles. \"Structured products, especially ABS, have lagged the spread retracement we have seen in corporate bonds following the recent tariff-related volatility,\" Cunniffe said. \"This, along with continued higher levels of new ABS issuance, have created an attractive relative value opportunity in ABS.\"",

      "content": "An old school, tech workhorse is having a rough post-earnings session, but has still managed to trounce the S & P 500 in 2025 – and also rewards long-term investors who are seeking portfolio income. International Business Machines sold off sharply Thursday, down 7.6%, as investors punished the tech company when it missed Wall Street's estimates for software revenue in the second quarter . Software revenue for IBM came in at $7.39 billion, up about 10% from the year-ago period, but below the StreetAccount consensus estimate of $7.43 billion. IBM YTD mountain IBM shares in 2025 The software revenue overshadowed an otherwise solid quarter for IBM, when adjusted earnings came in at $2.80 per share on revenue of $16.98 billion, topping the $2.64 per share and $16.59 billion LSEG consensus. The 114-year-old tech bellwether also lifted its full-year cash flow guidance to more than $13.5 billion. \"We believe that IBM is well-positioned to capitalize on the current demand shift for hybrid and [artificial intelligence] applications with more enterprises looking to implement AI for productivity gains and drive this long-term profitable growth,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a Thursday note. He said he would be a buyer \"of any knee-jerk weakness\" post earnings. Those who do snap up IBM shares while they're on sale – and stick with them for the long run – could be rewarded. The original blue chip tech stock has been steadily raising its dividend for decades, and investors who use each quarter's income to buy more shares could see enhanced returns over time. A dividend aristocrat Dating back to 1926, dividends have contributed about 31% of the total return of the S & P 500, while capital appreciation has contributed 69%, according to S & P Global . IBM is in an elite crowd of stocks, known as the dividend aristocrats. These are companies that have raised their annual dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. For its part, IBM has now increased its dividend for 30 straight years, with the company most recently announcing a hike in April to $1.68 a share. IBM has a current dividend yield of 2.6%, and its annual dividend payment per share adds up to $6.72. But the real power of the income payment comes in the form of compounding growth over time and using those dividends to buy more shares. On a price basis, IBM shares are up 18% in 2025, but its total return – factoring in reinvested dividends – is closer to 20%, according to FactSet calculations. That compares to an 8% increase on a price basis for the S & P 500 this year, and an 8.9% total return. Where investors really see the difference, though, is when they stick with a stock for the long run and make a point of reinvesting those dividend payments. Over the past 20 years, IBM's share price went up more than 220%, but on a total return basis the appreciation comes to more than 490%, reflecting the reward investors receive not just from buying additional stock but also from receiving added dividends on all those newly-accumulated shares. A way to dollar-cost average Investors can check with their brokerage firm to enroll in dividend reinvestment plans, which are known as DRIPs. The benefit of enrolling in a DRIP is that it allows investors to dollar-cost average into a position, meaning they buy shares at regular intervals regardless of the price action. There's no waiting for fire sales. You'll want to be picky about which names you reinvest in, though. Stocks with unreasonably high dividend yields may be on a downward trajectory, and companies that are under pressure may be forced to cut their payments to save cash. Investors can also consider diversifying their approach and snap up a dividend-focused ETF instead. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) has an e pense ratio of 0.05% and a return of 7.3% in 2025. Its constituents include Broadcom, Microsoft and Costco Wholesale. Meanwhile, the ProShares S & P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) has an e pense ratio of 0.35% and a 2025 return of nearly 6%. Names in the fund include Emerson Electric, Caterpillar and Fastenal.",

      "content": "Alphabet's strong earnings report seems to be quashing any fears on Wall Street that the artificial intelligence trade has peaked. The Google parent's second-quarter results — released on Wednesday afternoon — painted a healthy picture of the tech stalwart's current AI ambitions. Back in February, the company forecast it would invest an e pected $75 billion in capital e penditures this year as builds out its AI offerings. But on Wednesday, the company upped this figure to $85 billion, justifying this increase by pointing to \"strong and growing demand for our Cloud products and services.\" Boosted by Alphabet's positive second-quarter earnings, chip stocks such as Nvidia , Broadcom , Micron , ASML and Advanced Micro Devices all rose during Thursday's session. GOOGL 1D mountain Alphabet shares in the past day If Alphabet's earnings report is any indication, the competition amongst tech old guards to build the best and biggest AI products is merely in its first innings, according to Wolfe Research. \"Alphabet's results provided further fuel for the AI spending narrative as demand for AI products drove an increase in sales and capital spending, with GOOGL raising its outlook to spend an additional $10B in 2025,\" the firm wrote in a Thursday note. It continued: \"Our sense is GOOGL's results will continue to spur the AI 'Arms Race' across Mag 7 companies and the market as a whole. We e pect further upside revisions to capital spending by the Mag 7 over the course of this earnings season as the race heats up and companies continue to invest heavily as aggregate spending is set to grow 40% y/y in 2025.\" Wall Street's reaction Across Wall Street, analysts such as Bernstein's Mark Shmulik and UBS' Randy Abrams highlighted Alphabet's foray into the AI arena as they parsed the company's results . \"Investors have long been clamoring for Google to get more 'aggressive' in the AI race, with solid performance in Search and Cloud pointing to solid [return on invested capital] thus far,\" Shmulik wrote. \"Google was the first hyperscaler to report and will be a positive signal if its peers echo similar sentiment of higher demand further pushing up spending and delaying the point on catching demand,\" Abrams said. \"For the tech supply chain, TSMC already kicked off the season discussing its expectations on AI led demand through 2026 and we e pect hardware results over the next few weeks to still see ramps though 2H25.\" Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black pointed to this increased AI demand as a bright spot on Alphabet's latest report. \"Cape expectations for FY25 increased by $10bn to $85bn despite continued supply constraints as AI Investments and Cloud infrastructure supply requirements still outpace demand,\" Black wrote. Brian Nowak, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, underscored that Alphabet's innovative investments could be a longer-term catalyst driving upside in the years to come. \"Search, YouTube and Google Cloud all accelerated as GenAI-enabled innovation is driving faster growth,\" the analyst said. \"Our EPS ests are largely unchanged.... but we remain OW as this accelerated pace of innovation sets up GOOGL for more durable multi-year growth.\" Barclays analyst Ross Sandler and Ronald Josey of Citi pointed out that Wednesday's results show that Alphabet's previous investments are finally beginning to pay off. \"Alphabet showed off a lot of great metrics in 2Q, everything from search paid clicks to cloud revenues are accelerating on the back of years of heavy AI investments,\" Sandler wrote. \"Given Google's Commercial and AI queries continue to grow as its AI surfaces support more use cases now that AI-O is global, AI Mode e pands, and Gemini adoption ramps, Google's newer products appear to be resonating as its strategy comes into view,\" Josey added. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth was similarly bullish on the company's print. \"Google delivered what we believe is a defining quarter w/32% Google Cloud revenue growth, increasing scale of AI search products, and greater benefits from AI across every part of the business,\" Anmuth said. \"We believe the combination of strong AI-driven Cloud demand and accelerating backlog makes Google Cloud a bigger driver of the bull case going forward.\"",

      "content": "(This is The Best Stocks in the Market , brought to you by Josh Brown and Sean Russo of Ritholtz Wealth Management.) Josh — In 1973, The Chicago Board of Trade launched a subsidiary that would allow traders to place bets on a new standardized contract based on stock prices. These contracts, similar to but separate from the CBOT's bread-and-butter commodity futures products, were called options. They carved out a single trading pit on the floor for these stock option contracts and standardized how they worked. At first, there were options on just si teen publicly traded companies, like IBM. In due time, more were added. Stocks were e traordinarily volatile in the mid-1970s with back-to-back bear markets and lots of opportunities for both speculation and protecting portfolios. The business was a hit. When the early 1980's bull market got underway, this \"Chicago Board Options E change\" or CBOE (usually pronounced as C-Bow) grew into a hive of trader activity. In 1983, the first contract on a stock market inde came along when the CBOE unveiled its S & P 100 options offering. If you've ever seen the ticker \"OE \" cross the bottom of your CNBC screen, that's the one. Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) is now one of the best financial services businesses in the world and this week it made the Best Stocks in the Market list. Ever since the next generation of retail traders came along during the pandemic, it's been a bull run for options trading. In its July 3, 2025 report, Cboe said that June 2025 trading volume hit a new all-time record. They reported the highest ever quarterly average daily volume for S & P 500 options at 3.7 million contracts, and zero‑day-to‑e piry (0DTE) options at 2.1 million contracts. Zero days to e piration trading — which we refer to as 0DTE — continues to boom. Did you know that over 60% of S & P 500 option trades are 0DTE? It's wild given how new this type of contract is. Retail traders are estimated to be responsible for over half of this activity. Sean's going to give you the set-up on Cboe stock, which has been moving in a tightly wound, neat little uptrend all summer long. I'll be back at the end with a risk management comment. Best Stock Spotlight: Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE) On the list since: 7/22/2025 Sean — Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) made it onto the list this week. When I pulled up the chart, I knew I had to show Josh right away. The stock's lack of volatility is remarkable as you can see in the logarithmic chart since inception. The lack of volatility has given the stock a beta of 0.43 compared to the overall market's beta of 1.0, which means CBOE has about half the volatility of the S & P 500. For obvious reasons, this makes for an attractive risk-reward and many portfolio managers love building allocations with stocks like these. Despite its lack of volatility, CBOE has been anything but quiet. The stock has massively outperformed the S & P 500 since coming public 15 years ago, returning a cumulative 854% (inclusive of dividends) since inception vs. a 647% total return for the S & P 500, or 16% annualized vs 14% for the S & P 500. (data via YCharts). Ever since the trading boom of 2020, CBOE's fundamental outlook has been stellar. The increase in trading activity has led to an increase in the need for e change-traded products as well as the underlying data tied to those products. S & P 500 options trading volume has been growing 8% a year over the last five years, while VI options volume has been growing at a 15% annual clip. In addition to the increased popularity of its trading products, CBOE is also in the midst of adding more recurring, higher-quality subscription products so they can become less reliant on transaction volume over time. Cboe's non-transaction revenue business includes Data and Access Solutions (DnA), providing data, infrastructure, and global market access to its customers. The e change's infrastructure and proprietary market data are getting leveraged into recurring revenue streams through subscription-based services. Unlike transaction-based revenues that fluctuate with market volatility, their DnA business provides steady, predictable income that complements the trading business. Said otherwise, the firm is leveraging higher-quality revenue. You can e pect the market to award this improvement in \"earnings quality\" with a higher multiple. From 2020 through their last reported quarter, CBOE has grown revenues 5%, operating income 13%, and diluted EPS 14% on an annualized basis. CBOE is due to report next week on Friday, August 1st. Analysts e pect Revenue of $575M up 12% year-over-year and EPS of $2.43, up 13% year-over-year. (Data via Quartr) Risk Management: Josh: If this were heaven, and not earth, this is what every stock chart would look like and we would just buy them all. You can see below how perfectly the buyers came in to save this name from a 200-day trend break during the market volatility in April. Investors in this name know that volatility is actually a good thing if you're the largest options e change and clearing operation in the world. Earnings next week could produce a blip, which I would most likely ignore so long as the company does the number and guides up. For shorter-term traders, I'd use 220 as a pivot point. It retested that level in mid-June and bounced off it clean. If it gets below, there might be better set-ups elsewhere. Investors should obey the rising 200-day and check back every Friday close.

      "source": "CNBC-Economy",
      "content": "Slightly over a year ago, CNN hosted a debate between then-President Joe Biden and Former (and current) President Donald Trump. President Biden's approval rating heading into the debate was already low. The Pew Research Center's survey in April of 2024 showed that the number of U.S. adults who disapproved of his performance as President vastly outnumbered those who approved. Times/Siena polls suggested Trump led Biden by about 3% among likely voters ahead of the debate, and that lead widened to 6% after Biden's poor peformance and ultimately, he bowed to pressure from his own party to withdraw from the race. It was at this point, when the prospect of Trump returning to the White House went from possibility to probability, that economists and investors really began to weigh in on the implications of \"Trumponomics\" 2.0. Much of what was published at the time e pressed significant concerns about some of his proposals, so much so that on July 11th, 2024, the Economist published an opinion piece entitled, \"Trumponomics would not be as bad as most e pect.\" The authors taking a fairly balanced view said, \"Mr. Trump and his advisers have many rotten ideas. They also have some decent ones.\" This week marked two milestones. It has been si months since Mr. Trump was once again sworn in as president of the United States, and the S & P 500 just hit another all-time high. We are also kicking off the first earnings season, where publicly traded companies will report a full quarter's worth of operating results under the new administration. .SP 1Y mountain S & P 500 , 1 year During this period, the markets e perienced historic volatility induced by policy proposals. However, did the chaos we observed in stock prices reflect chaos in corporate operating results? Early indications from both economic data and the ~10% of the Russell 3000 that have reported so far since July 1st are actually pretty good. A higher percentage of companies that have reported since July 1st of this year gave a positive revenue surprise, a smaller percentage reported a negative earnings surprise, the percentage above consensus for both revenues and earnings is higher this year, and earnings have averaged 10.9% growth YoY, well above long-term growth rates. So was The Economist right? Here are some points to consider. While tariff threats have been substantial, we still don't know where e actly that will land. The government has benefited from additional tariff revenue, and some price increases are being seen. One potential reason revenues and earnings could rise is that businesses are pricing products in anticipation of tariffs, but due to delays, the impact has not yet been fully felt. Economists warned of another inflationary impact. Cracking down on illegal immigration would increase labor costs. So far, this too does not appear to be creating huge disruptions, but while border crossings have slowed to a trickle, deportations, while causing a bit of a political firestorm in some cities, have a real impact that is muted because, by its own reckoning, the White House claims 100,000 deportations since January 20th. At that pace, the administration won't be able to deport even 10% of those who entered the country illegally under Biden, and because they are (supposedly) focusing on criminals, those deportations are not likely to impact wages paid at legitimate industries (yet). While the White House has been highly critical of Fed rate policy generally and Chairman Jerome Powell specifically, and the next appointee is likely to be more aligned with Trump's rate wishes, FOMC rate policy is still by committee. History has not been kind to political interference in central banking activities, and it's likely that even if the new chairman adopts a more dovish stance, the FOMC will remember the mistakes the Fed made during the Arthur Burns era. If they do vote to cut rates, I believe it will be based on inflation and employment data, not White House rhetoric. Deficits remain a complete disaster. Where in the past the predominant parties would at least pay lip service by either demanding higher ta es or lower spending, that appears to be out the window in DC these days. Valuations in several sectors are well above long-term averages relative to the market and to their own sector history. The most notable e ception is healthcare. Time to hedge? Any or all of these factors could reemerge as a threat to equities, and while there are still several weeks until Labor Day, it's worth remembering that September and October are months that have seen significant volatility in past years. With the CBOE Volatility Inde (VI ) just over 15 as I write this, below the 10-year average of 18.6 and in the 39th percentile, now might be a good time to consider adding some hedges, either to high-flying constituents of one's portfolio via put spreads or, more generally, by purchasing some relatively low cost put spreads on an equity market pro y, such as SPDR S & P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). For e ample, the Sep 30th, month-ending 630/600 put spread, which e pires in 67 days costs less than 1% of the underlying.

      "content": "Wall Street analysts scrambled to keep up with GE Vernova this week, dramatically hiking their stock price targets after the power company's shares blew past expectations on a strong second quarter. Its shares rallied more than 14% on Wednesday to close at an all-time high, after raising its full-year guidance as robust power demand blunts the effect of President Donald Trump's tariffs. Its stock nearly doubled this year to book the second-best performance in the S & P 500. \"Given what we viewed as elevated expectations ahead of GEV's 2Q25 earnings, we are somewhat surprised in the strength of GEV shares' outperformance,\" Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz told clients in a note published Wednesday. But rather than dismissing the rally as e uberance, Citi hiked its stock price target by $126 and now sees GE Vernova shares hitting $670, suggesting a modest upside of more than 6% over Wednesday's close. The company has the potential to sustain a much higher share price than Citi e pected because it is a \"prime beneficiary of growing global power demand,\" Kaplowitz said. Its gas turbines are in high demand from artificial intelligence data center developers with its order backlog continuing to grow. Equipment orders jumped more than 135% \"which gives more confidence in the 'stronger for longer' narrative in the global gas market,\" Wolfe Research analyst Nigel Coe told clients Wednesday. GE Vernova is also a leader in the development of small modular nuclear reactors , an emerging technology that could play a major role in the company's future. It is the first Western company to break ground on a commercial SMR with construction underway in Ontario. Its offshore wind power segment still faces challenges but appears \"relatively contained and, for now, mainly overlooked given positive momentum elsewhere in the portfolio,\" Kaplowitz said. Bank of America was also bullish, bumping its price by $105 to set a target of $725 per share, implying 15% upside from Wednesday's close. Data centers placed $500 million of orders for the company's electric equipment in the first half of 2025, compared to $600 million in all of 2025, the bank noted. \"We argue that a premium multiple is warranted given above-peer earnings growth and margin trajectory,\" BofA analyst Andrew Obin told clients in a Wednesday note. Wells Fargo, meanwhile, raised its price by a whopping $224 to a target of $674 per share, indicating 7% upside from Wednesday's close. This reflects favorable long-term tailwinds for GE Vernova and higher prices for its turbines and electric equipment supporting greater revenue, analyst Michael Blum told clients in a Thursday note. Wolfe Research, however, did sound a note of caution amid all the bullish sentiment on Wall Street: \"There's a lot to like, but a lot is priced in,\" Coe said.",

Shares of Spotify have rallied 51% so far this year. The Lu embourg-based company earlier this year recorded its first full year of profitability when it released fourth-quarter results. First-quarter results in April showed 12% year-over-year growth in subscribers to 268 million, and a 4 percentage-point increase in gross profit margin to 31.6%. Looking ahead, Helfstein said Spotify can make more money from new and existing users. Compound annual growth in revenue through 2030 is e pected to reach 16%, boosted by 9% annual increases in subscribers and average revenue per user rising 21%, he said. \"For years SPOT has meaningfully under-monetized its free tier, using this as a conversion funnel, as the company tries to scale advertising,\" the analyst said. SPOT 1Y mountain Spotify stock over the past year. Helfstein cited several tailwinds for his upgrade, including expectations that: Spotify boasts the \"longest runway\" among large-cap internet stocks to increase its number of monthly active users, or MAU, and capture a majority of listeners that are abandoning terrestrial radio (Spotify in the fourth quarter recorded 675 million MAUs, while analysts polled by StreetAccount e pected 664.3 million). A widely e pected, higher-priced \"Superfan\" tier will drive revenue. Spotify will likely monetize its free/lowest fee over time, unlocking a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity.

Alphabet on Wednesday e ceeded top- and bottom-line estimates , and saw its overall revenue jump 14% year over year — higher than the 10.9% Wall Street e pected. The company also e pects more AI-related spending, lifting its capital e penditures forecast for 2025 due to \"strong and growing demand for our Cloud products and services.\" The robust results quelled investors fears that the search engine giant's artificial intelligence strategy is flailing compared with peers, particularly as chatbots such as OpenAI and Perple ity compete in the growing online search market. Several analysts reiterated their bullish ratings on shares while lifting their estimates, as they remain optimistic in Google's cloud growth and uptick in AI Overviews monthly user gains. Here's a look at what some had to say: Morgan Stanley reiterates overweight rating, lifts price target by $5 to $210 Analyst Brian Nowak is confident in Google's accelerating cloud revenue growth and the company's updated AI-based engagement metrics. His new price target suggests about 10.4% potential upside. \"Search, YouTube and Google Cloud all accelerated as GenAI-enabled innovation is driving faster growth,\" he wrote in a Thursday note to clients. \"Our EPS ests are largely unchanged (revenue higher offset by higher D & A/investment) but we remain OW as this accelerated pace of innovation sets up GOOGL for more durable multi-year growth.\" Goldman Sachs keeps buy rating, raises price target by $9 to $234 Analyst Eric Sheridan said he sees Alphabet as well positioned in current and future computing landscapes. \"We continue to be of the view (contrary to some negative investor sentiment currently) that Alphabet can successfully navigate the current multi-year evolution of its core Search product by leveraging its current strengths,\" Sheridan wrote in a note. \"We found Alphabet mgmt team's commentary on the earnings call supportive of a multi-surface approach to AI ... In addition, we see the company's Cloud business as poised to benefit over the medium-to-long term.\" Deutsche Bank maintains buy rating, lifts price target by $15 to $215 Analyst Benjamin Black's price target suggests about 13% potential upside. Black increased his forward revenue growth forecast, driven by increased growth expectations in Google's search and cloud businesses. \"Engagement with Alphabet's AI Overview (AIO) has been particularly strong, especially among younger users, driving incremental queries and demonstrating solid monetization, even at this early stage of adoption,\" the analyst said in a note. \"AIOs have already reached over 2bn MAUs globally, and are contributing to over 10% of incremental query growth where available, which suggests there is significant room for upside as adoption increases.\" JPMorgan: reiterates overweight rating, raises price target by $32 to $232 JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth is sticking behind Alphabet after noting that Google AI search products have continued to scale. Anmuth added that although Google's 2025 cape outlook increased by $10 billion to $85 billion, he believes it is a strong sign of growing AI demand and \"better ability for Google to invest given improving access to AI infrastructure.\" \"Google delivered what we believe is a defining quarter w/32% Google Cloud revenue growth, increasing scale of AI search products, and greater benefits from AI across every part of the business,\" Anmuth said in a Thursday note. \"We believe the combination of strong AI-driven Cloud demand and accelerating backlog makes Google Cloud a bigger driver of the bull case going forward.\"",

      "content": "Wall Street ratings were a mi ed bag after Tesla's second-quarter financial results. Tesla on Wednesday reported a second straight quarter of declining automotive sales , which came in at $16.7 billion for the period, down from $19.9 billion in the same quarter last year. The company also missed on top and bottom lines. Shares of the electric vehicle maker plunged 6% in premarket trading, piling on its roughly 17.7% year-to-date loss. Tesla has struggled in key markets such as China and Europe and notably lost market share to Chinese companies that have released lower-cost EV models. Still, analysts have a wide range of ratings and price targets on Tesla shares. It's a company that bulls tend to stick by for its future value in technologies such as robota is, not necessarily its near-term innovation. Analysts polled by LSEG have a consensus price target on Tesla that implies more than 9% downside for Tesla shares. Of the 54 analysts covering the stock, five rate it a strong buy, while 19 rate it a buy and 20 maintain a hold. Ten have an underperform or sell rating on shares. Here's a look at what some Wall Street majors said after the EV maker's earnings release: Goldman Sachs keeps neutral rating, lifts price target to $300 Analyst Mark Delaney raised his 12-month price target to $300 from $285. He said he e pects Tesla's revenue growth and profits to improve in 2026, but is keeping his estimates below the FactSet consensus. \"We believe a key focus for investors going forward will be the ability for revenue and profits to reaccelerate driven by Tesla's AI enabled products (e.g. robota is, FSD) and new vehicle launches against a more difficult policy environment and given competition,\" Delaney said in a Wednesday note. \"Management did note the potential for the end of IRA EV purchase incentives in 4Q to temporarily pressure fundamentals, but the shift to AI enabled products including robota is/FSD and Optimus would be a substantial long-term driver.\" Wells Fargo reiterates underweight rating, $120 price target Wells Fargo sees major room for downside ahead. Analyst Colin Langan's price target implies Tesla shares stand to lose nearly 64% from their latest close of $332.56 per share. Tesla shares are down in post-earnings trading \"despite a Q2 op margin beat as fundamentals look worse into 2H. TSLA did not provide new delivery guidance & warned of added pressure from tariffs, IRA & OBBB. We agree with 2H concerns & remain UW,\" Langan wrote in a Thursday note. He remains cautious on robota is, even after CEO Elon Musk's bullish commentary that robota is will \"probably address half the population of the U.S.\" by year-end, and that Tesla e pects an Optimus 3 prototype by the end of the year to scale next year. Langan said scaling robota is and Optimus humanoids could take longer than e pected, which he believes raises risks as Tesla's core business weakens. Morgan Stanley maintains overweight rating, $410 price target Analyst Adam Jonas is a well-known Tesla bull. He reiterated Tesla as a top pick and kept a target price that implies about 23% potential upside. Still, Jonas lowered his fiscal 2025 earnings per share expectations by 14% compared to prior forecasts, mostly driven by lower deliveries and higher operating e penses. \"2Q numbers were a slight beat with FCF near break-even. Tesla is crossing the chasm to autonomy while absorbing slower volume, EV incentive elimination, tariffs and investing in new initiatives that may not make margins for years,\" Jonas said in a note about Tesla's results. \"Our OW rating and $410 price target are underpinned by our belief that Tesla's capabilities in key areas of physical AI … offer growth and margin opportunities that greatly e ceed those of the traditional EV business, which is under pressure,\" he added. \"We struggle to think of any other company as well positioned as Tesla in terms of data, robotics, energy, AI, manufacturing and supporting infrastructure.\" Bank of America reiterates neutral rating, $341 price target Analyst Federico Merendi anticipates \"rough quarters ahead\" for Tesla, echoing Musk's commentary. His neutral rating on the stock relies on Tesla's current market advantage in autonomous driving initiatives and physical AI applications, he said. \"Tesla commentary on future developments in terms of real-world AI (Autonomous vehicles/robota i and Optimus) remains bullish. However, the company is facing challenging times,\" he wrote in a note to clients. \"Commentary also suggests that the tariff impact may increase in the future. However, by end of 2026, management thinks that Tesla's economics will be compelling with autonomy at scale.\" Evercore ISI maintains in-line rating, $235 price target Analyst Chris McNally e pects Tesla's third-quarter results to see the downbeat effects of slower EV launches and tariff impacts. \"The LT negative EPS revision trend has continued, unabated,\" he said in a note. \"We believe there will be a sharper cons move post Q3.\"",

      "content": "The energy sector is lagging the S & P 500 this year, but Wolfe Research spotted a couple of stocks that could be poised to gain. Oil prices have been soft this year, with West Te as Intermediate crude futures off about 9% per barrel, and Brent crude futures down 8%. Supply of the commodity has remained plentiful, and eight members of the OPEC+ cartel agreed earlier this month to lift production by 548,000 barrels a day. Similarly, the performance of energy stocks has been lackluster, with the S & P 500 sector only up by about 1% in 2025 versus 8% for the broad market inde . Nevertheless, there are some gems in the space, according to Rob Ginsberg, technical analyst at Wolfe. \"The landscape of the sector remains in the favor of stock pickers with outperformers being few and far between,\" he wrote in a report Monday, highlighting a \"compelling\" name that's on the verge of breaking out. Peabody Energy St. Louis-based coal miner Peabody Energy turned up on Ginsberg's radar, showing \"one of the most convincing charts within energy.\" Ginsberg said that the stock's 200-day moving average at $18 is the next level of resistance as momentum continues to build. BTU 3M mountain Peabody Energy in the past three months \"We e pect it to be tested in coming weeks, with a breakout through that level likely to follow,\" the chart watcher said. Peabody closed Tuesday at $17.34, and the stock pays a dividend yield of 1.7% — fatter than the S & P 500 yield of 1.18%. Though shares have had a rough year thus far, down 17% in 2025, Peabody has recently seen a resurgence. The stock has soared 42% in the past three months, and 28% in July alone. Peabody's hot streak coincides with President Donald Trump's moves to take a lighter approach toward environmental regulations and his administration's support for the coal industry to help power the growth of artificial intelligence . Earlier this month, the president granted two years of regulatory relief to coal plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities and some chemical manufacturers. Peabody shares are well liked on Wall Street, with most analysts covering the St. Louis-based coal producer rating it a buy or strong buy, according to LSEG.

      "content": "Morgan Stanley e pects a handful of stocks that are reporting quarterly results soon to see big gains. Second-quarter earnings season has so far impressed Wall Street, even as investors keep an eye on commentary about tariff-related uncertainty and artificial intelligence spending and demand. Of the 88 S & P 500 companies that have reported results, more than 82% have beaten analysts' estimates, according to FactSet data. Analyst Michelle Weaver wrote in a Tuesday note to clients that Morgan Stanley e pects a \"normal\" rate of companies outpacing earnings estimates this season. \"Given the downward EPS revisions we saw in April / May and the subsequent recovery in Earnings Revisions Breadth from –25% to ~1% , we e pect the inde to deliver 2Q beat rates roughly in line with historical averages (4-5%),\" Weaver wrote. She added, earnings should be \"top-heavy,\" led by strong year-over-year \"Magnificent Seven\" net income growth. Below are five of Morgan Stanley's 13 highest conviction plays. These are stocks in which near-term catalysts should drive \"a meaningful move\" upward, according to the firm. Morgan Stanley views Nvidia as an earnings winner. The firm rates the chipmaking giant overweight with a $170 price target, which implies 1.8% potential upside. \"E pect the pace of revenue and EPS to accelerate on the print, as demand remains very strong and NVDA continues to deliver upside on the supply side having resolved issues with rack scale products,\" the firm said about the stock. Analysts are bullish that Nvidia's revenue growth in the second half of 2025 and 2026 will improve after the company resumes shipments of previously banned H20 chips to China. CVS Health is another name Morgan Stanley likes, with an overweight rating and a price target that implies the stock could gain about 31%. Analyst Erin Wright called CVS a \"compelling turnaround story in Managed Care,\" given its focus on the Medicare Advantage business, which she said has earnings power. \"CVS should be a cleaner print in what has been a volatile period for Managed Care, with another 'beat and maintain' or ~in line quarter likely, in our view, offering welcomed relief,\" Wright said. CVS in the first quarter e ceeded estimates and hiked its earnings guidance , but did not provide a revenue forecast given uncertainty with higher medical costs from more Medicare Advantage patients returning to hospitals. CVS 1Y mountain CVS Health performance over the past year. AI data center play Eaton has room for upside, according to analyst Chris Snyder. He views the stock as attractively positioned heading into earnings due to margins in its Electrical Americas business. \"We have confidence in both ETNs pricing power & ability to drive volumes higher given company backlog and ongoing capacity adds,\" the analyst said.",

      "source": "CNBC-Economy",
      "content": "The VanEck Oil Services ETF (OIH) may not be making headlines lately — especially with large-cap growth and meme stocks dominating both the news cycle and performance rankings — but it has been showing signs of life, which we should keep on our radar going forward. First, it's clear that the ETF has been trending higher since the April lows, though the advance has been jagged so far. OIH has been making higher lows, but each rally attempt has eventually been sold into. That being said, both of the recent pullbacks have respected the rising 50-day moving average, which now has begun to act as support, along with the breakout zone from early June around 225. If we see more follow-through going forward — and potentially a breakout from a second bullish pattern (highlighted in green below) — that would be a clear constructive development on the charts. Additionally, the 14-day RSI has recently bottomed near the 50-midpoint, which is a step in the right direction. This is in stark contrast to what occurred from February through April, when OIH consistently failed to stay above its 50-day moving average and the RSI struggled to rise above its midpoint. Zooming out a bit further, we can see that technical challenges remain ahead. On this chart, there's a confluence of resistance — with three resistance lines all converging just under $260 zone. First, the breakdown zone from earlier this year is marked by a horizontal line. In addition, the downtrend line drawn from the July 2024 high also e tends down to that same area. Finally, the 200-day moving average, which is downward sloping, is essentially hugging that same downtrend line. All three converge near 260, creating a clear cluster of supply that OIH must contend with. In the bottom panel, we again see the 14-day RSI from the first chart — this time highlighting what has happened in the past when the indicator has returned to overbought territory. Historically, those moments have coincided with faded advances. Needless to say, OIH must do a better job of first negotiating this cluster of resistance and then proving it can advance even while overbought — something it hasn't successfully done in over a year. Lastly, here is a weekly chart that goes all the way back to 2005. It highlights the rare occasions when OIH endured weekly declines of at least 20%. As is clear, these events have been uncommon, occurring in 2008, 2020, and most recently in 2025. There are a few common characteristics that appeared during those 20% down weeks. First, they occurred toward the end of much larger selloffs — with the previous episodes resulting in total drawdowns of appro imately 70%. Second, each of those major declines was followed by a powerful multi-year rebound. From the 2008 lows through early 2011, OIH rallied 150%. From the COVID lows in 2020 to the 2023 high, the ETF gained 370% Most recently, OIH sold off more than 40% from the 2023 high to its 2025 low just a few months ago. Since then, it has rallied about 30% — a substantial move in a short amount of time, but still much smaller than the prior rebounds. If, for e ample, OIH were to rally 100% from the recent trough, the ETF would be trading near $415. That would place it above the 2023 high and back to levels last seen in 2018, though still below the breakdown zone that developed during that earlier period. Ultimately, for OIH to take the next step and sustain this advance, it must not only continue breaking out from bullish patterns, but — more importantly — prove it can withstand the next pullback. That means remaining above the rising 50-day moving average in the near term, which would give it a legitimate shot at overtaking the key resistance levels outlined earlier. — Frank Cappelleri Founder: https://cappthesis.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions e pressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

      "content": "Tesla is slated to release second-quarter results after the stock market's closing bell Wednesday, and most analysts are adopting a cautious stance toward Elon Musk's flagship business. Earlier this month, the electric vehicle maker reported a 14% decline in second-quarter vehicle deliveries . Now, analysts surveyed by LSEG e pect that Tesla will see earnings slump 21% from a year ago, to 41 cents per share, on $22.62 billion in revenue, down more than 11% from the year-earlier period. Those declines would compound the dominant U.S. EV company's first-quarter results, which missed Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Automotive revenue plummeted 20% in the first quarter from a year prior, while total revenue slipped 9%. Shares of Tesla reached their lows of the year in April but have since recovered following CEO Elon Musk's withdrawal from his position leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. After soaring almost 40% over the past three months, Tesla is now down 18% on the year. TSLA YTD mountain TSLA YTD chart Heading into earnings, Wall Street appears split on Tesla. LSEG data shows that 23 of 53 analysts rate the stock a buy or strong buy, while 20 assign it a hold rating. Here's what analysts at some of Wall Street's biggest banks are saying before Tesla's latest earnings report. UBS: sell rating and $215 price target UBS's price target implies the risk of 35% downside ahead, based on Tuesday's close. \"We continue to believe Tesla is fundamentally overvalued. We see deteriorating fundamentals in the auto business, the removal of 100% margin credit revenue, likely negative revisions to estimates, and a CEO that arguably distracted from the business (or at least may not be as focused on the company as investors would like). However, Tesla is perhaps the ultimate story-narrative-momentum-meme stock. So near-term stock action will be heavily dependent on call commentary/tone.\" Evercore ISI: in-line, $235 The firm's forecast is roughly 29% below where shares of Tesla closed on Tuesday. \"TSLA – CAUTIOUS. We believe the stock, today, is increasingly both NOISE & SIGNAL based on: 1) Unabated negative revisions, 2) Disappointing [autonomous vehicle] rollout, 3) Increasingly divisive political posting, & 4) Technicals on edge.\" Barclays: equal weight, $275 Analyst Dan Levy's target would equate to another 17% downside in the stock. \"Key takes: 1. Confusing set-up on 2Q with weak fundamentals, but could see positive reaction on better robota i narrative; 2. E pecting modest gross margin improvement: volume improved, but increased promotion; 3. E pect more significant '25 volume decline, low-cost model potentially delayed to 4Q25.\" Baird: neutral, $320 Analyst Ben Kallo's projection of where the stock should trade is almost 4% below Tesla's Tuesday close. \"Cautious stance ahead of busy EPS report. We see risk to estimates stemming from both 1) full-year volume outlook and 2) potential margin compression in the Energy segment. Both the unveiling of the more affordable vehicle (which is now delayed) and pull forward of deliveries due to the federal EV ta credit e piring may boost volumes, however, we are wary of potential cannibalization this vehicle may cause and remain cautious. We look for updates on the Tesla Semi, robota i rollout and Optimus in the Q2 report.\" Bank of America: neutral, $341 The bank's forecast is 3% above Tesla's Tuesday closing price. \"Tesla 2Q earnings results are likely to be challenged due to tariffs and disappointing deliveries. Although Tesla produces all its vehicles in the U.S. and it manufactures vehicle with a high proportion of content made in North America, the e posure to tariff is not insignificant. Tesla relies on batteries made in China, particularly for its battery business. 2H25 is likely mi ed because 3Q25 may benefit from demand pull forward in the U.S. while 4Q25 may be challenged due to the phase out of IRA incentives. On a more positive note, TSLA did start its Robota i service in Austin, T . This gives us more confidence on the promise to deliver unsupervised [Full Self-Driving vehicles by the end of 2025.\" Deutsche Bank: buy, $345 Analyst Edison Yu's forecast implies Tesla shares might rise 4% over the coming 12 months. \"Looking at the rest of the year, we maintain a cautious stance on volume calling for 1.58m vehicle deliveries (-12% YoY) vs. consensus +1.62m, with the timing of Model Q rollout as the key swing factor (we now assume only 25k in 4Q).\" Cantor Fitzgerald: overweight, $355 Cantor Fitzgerald's target suggests Tesla might advance another 7% in the next year. \"We update our Q2 estimates to account for 2Q25 vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployed. We lower our 2Q25 revenue estimate to ~$21B (vs. our prior estimate of $24.1B), to reflect Q2 vehicle deliveries, and a reduction in energy generation and storage revenue. No change to our 2025 and 2026 annual revenue and EPS estimates.\" Piper Sandler: overweight, $400 Piper Sandler's forecast corresponds to upside of around 20%. \"It recently emerged that Tesla has begun validating robo-ta is in Marble Falls, T , which is well outside the company's existing robo-ta i range (in Austin, T ). In our view, these favorable FSD-related developments are likely to overshadow any/all negative commentary arising from lower 2025/2026 estimates. As a result of this dynamic, we e pect TSLA to trade closer to the high-end of its historical valuation range, when e pressed in terms of out-year P/E.\" Stifel: buy, $450 Analyst Stephen Gengaro's target implies about 36% upside from Tesla's Tuesday close. \"We believe TSLA is very well positioned to deliver robust multi-year growth in 2024-27+. In the near term, the revamped Model 3 and upcoming Model Y refresh should bolster sales, followed by the commencement of a lower-priced vehicle (Model 2) production that likely garners very strong demand. We also believe TSLA's AI-based Full Self-Driving (FSD) initiative has the potential to generate significant value through both sales of FSD, possible licensing agreements, and as [a] critical part of longer-term Cybercab (Robota i) initiatives.\" — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

With public finances under strain worldwide, the European Union’s approach aims to mobilize private capital by de-risking investment and supporting local initiatives. BRUSSELS – “Poverty,” Aristotle famously observed, “is the parent of revolution and crime.” History has repeatedly proven the point: inequality often fuels political and social instability, giving rise to conflict and despair. Today, in the face of widening economic disparities and climate disruption, international cooperation on sustainable development is no longer just an e pression of solidarity – it is a strategic imperative. Yet just as development challenges grow increasingly urgent, the resources to confront them are steadily declining. In 2015, world leaders adopted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), outlining a shared vision for a more equitable, low-carbon future. Since then, however, overlapping global crises – from the COVID-19 pandemic to rising geopolitical tensions and escalating climate change – have reversed much of the progress made over the past 25 years. The realities of our increasingly multipolar world call for a shift in mindset. Policymakers must focus on doing more with less, which means fostering effective partnerships between the public and private sectors. This was my main takeaway from the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) in Seville, Spain: to meet climate and social targets, we must rethink how development is financed – and by whom. While every country relies on access to financing to manage crises, support growth, and provide essential services, this need is especially acute in developing countries, where investment in infrastructure and human capital is crucial to long-term progress. To achieve the SDGs, developing countries will need to raise roughly $4 trillion annually . With development budgets under pressure globally, it is clear that public funding alone is not enough, and that closing today’s investment gap requires mobilizing private capital.

Subscribe Now Public budgets should serve as a catalyst, not a substitute, for private investment. That’s the thinking behind the European Union’s Global Gateway initiative , which focuses on creating the conditions necessary for sustainable financing. By combining guarantees, grants, and long-term loans, it aims to reduce risk, unlock private capital, and enable transformative investments in high-quality infrastructure projects, with a strong focus on education, job training, health, and climate resilience. At FfD4, for e ample, we signed a €75 million ($88 million) guarantee agreement with Spain’s COFIDES to e pand off-grid energy access in underserved regions across Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Projects like these often cannot move forward without effective risk mitigation. By reducing financial e posure, EU guarantees help make long-term financing viable and more accessible. We are also developing innovative financing vehicles such as the Digital Leap Fund , which uses grants, guarantees, and first-loss equity to attract private investors to projects they might otherwise avoid. The goal is to mobilize up to €500 million for digital infrastructure, including 5G networks, data centers, and broadband connectivity. At the same time, we are working to remove barriers to investment. As a former international banker, I understand that investors tend to seek safe, long-term returns – the kind that well-designed development projects can offer. But they also need predictability, transparency, and robust regulatory frameworks. Our local partners, for their part, need the capacity to build value chains that align with their strengths and priorities. Too often, developing countries that produce or e tract highly sought-after resources retain only a fraction of their final value. A cashew grown in Africa may be shipped to Asia for processing and then e ported to Europe, delivering limited benefits to local communities while imposing a high environmental cost. The EU’s value-based model tackles this imbalance head-on by focusing on three key areas: job creation and investment in skills, education, inclusion, and sustainability; high-quality infrastructure; and supporting local ownership, governance reform, and stable investment conditions. This approach is already being implemented in Angola and Zambia, where we are helping to transform the Lobito Corridor – an EU-backed project to renovate the railway linking Angola to landlocked, mineral-rich regions in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – into more than just a trade route for critical raw materials. To ensure that the economic benefits remain in the region, we are supporting vocational training, education, and local processing. In Zambia, we are using grants to strengthen sustainable agriculture, combining value-chain development with technical training in beekeeping, agro-processing, and rural entrepreneurship. Meanwhile, in Angola, we are investing in vocational programs tailored to the transportation, logistics, and energy industries. Achieving lasting impact requires long-term planning, which is why our approach is demand-driven, skills-oriented, and focused on creating good jobs and promoting local ownership. The Namibia Green Hydrogen Program , which aims to help Namibia realize its green hydrogen potential while supporting Europe’s energy transition, is a prime e ample. Led by national institutions and developed with private partners like Hyphen Hydrogen Energy, the project provides specialized training for workers in the hydrogen and electricity sectors. In fragile settings, the stakes are even higher. When institutions and basic services break down, instability and unrest often follow. With nearly one-quarter of the world’s population living in areas affected by conflict, natural disasters, and displacement, initiatives like the Global Gateway help bridge the gap between humanitarian aid and long-term development by working to restore essential services and build resilience where it is needed most. Europe has the tools to lead this effort, but lasting progress depends on local ownership, commitment, and resolve. National governments and local communities must take the lead on meaningful reform, effective governance, and sustainable development. Our role is to stand beside our partners and provide reliable, transparent support.

Asset owners, central banks, and institutions like the International Monetary Fund have a responsibility to integrate this awareness into all their activities. NEW YORK – On December 26, 2004, a massive undersea earthquake triggered a tsunami that left 230,000 people across Southeast Asia dead. Almost everyone, both human and animal, was caught off guard, with a notable e ception: elephants. In places like Thailand and Sri Lanka, elephants became agitated hours before the waves hit. Wild elephants fled to higher ground, and captive ones defied their handlers, sometimes with tourists still on their backs. Sensing low-frequency vibrations undetectable to most species, they acted on early warning signals – and were far more likely to survive. Today, another, far larger disaster is brewing, as rapid planetary warming and escalating environmental degradation threaten every sector of the global economy. And while many investors continue with business as usual, as if unaware of what is coming, one group is attempting to get out of harm’s way: long-term asset owners, such as pension funds and sovereign wealth managers. These investors, unlike hedge funds or private equity firms, take a generational view of the assets they manage. They cannot afford to ignore the ine tricable link between global financial stability and environmental stability, an awareness reflected in new initiatives like the Debt Suspension Clause Alliance and the Global Hub for Debt Swaps for Development . While some claim that accounting for climate change amounts to “mission creep” for global financial stewards like the International Monetary Fund, bellwether investors recognize that nature and climate risks will materialize in near- and medium-term shocks, affecting every facet of the global economy. So, even as many shareholders and CEOs remain focused on quarterly results, long-term asset owners have begun to scrutinize companies for natural-capital risk, in order to anticipate environmental shocks that could reduce the long-term value of their assets. Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, which manages $1.7 trillion in assets, is now assessing a whopping 96% of its portfolio for such risk. This is not some internal refinement of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) pledges; it is a major institutional change. Norway is not alone. Finland’s State Pension Fund recently began e ploring ways to quantify nature-related financial risks in relation to long-term pension liabilities. And Temasek Holdings in Singapore has started using satellite monitoring and biodiversity data to evaluate natural-capital risks and opportunities. At a time when ESG frameworks have become a flashpoint in political and culture wars, there can be no doubt that these actions are driven not by political pressures or social trends, but by pragmatism – and a growing sense of urgency. Already, e treme weather, biodiversity loss, water stress, and resource scarcity are disrupting economies, with vulnerable low-income countries especially hard hit.

In Indonesia, deforestation and peatland degradation from unsustainable palm-oil production led to the imposition of a temporary e port ban in 2022. In Brazil and Ethiopia, rising temperatures and erratic rainfall have slashed coffee yields in recent years, causing global prices to spike and undermining rural incomes and e port revenues. High-income countries are far from immune to these risks. In the United States, prolonged droughts are reducing crop yields from Arkansas to Oklahoma, forcing farmers to drill deeper wells and switch to less profitable crops. Meanwhile, climate-related disasters, such as hurricanes and wildfires, are causing home insurers to raise premiums, reduce coverage, and even e it high-risk regions. In Europe, nature-related risks have affected olive oil production in Italy and Greece; wine grapes in France, Italy, and Spain; timber supplies in Central and Northern Europe; fishing in the Mediterranean; and transport on the Rhine and Danube rivers. And this does not even begin to cover the vast human costs of the nature and climate crisis, evident in places like Valencia and Te as. Yet such risks have not been adequately priced into financial models. This is partly because data on natural capital, unlike on greenhouse-gas emissions, remain fragmented, inconsistent, and difficult to access. The risks are comple and systemic – water scarcity, biodiversity loss, and climate change cut across sectors and borders, triggering cascading effects – and there are no measuring or reporting standards in place. As a result, most banks lack the information they need, especially location-specific data, to evaluate borrowers’ environmental dependencies. But new tools are emerging that can help close these gaps. For e ample, E ploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and E posure (ENCORE) is a free online tool that helps financial institutions identify nature-related risks to which they are e posed through their lending, underwriting, and investment in high-risk industries. Moreover, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) has devised a set of disclosure recommendations and guidance aimed at helping businesses and financial institutions integrate nature into their decision-making. Some central banks have developed integrated scenario models aimed at assessing the impact of climate- and nature-related risks on the economy and financial system. Add to that new biodata technology, and the means to act are already here. Investors do not need to fly blind. This is no longer a matter of awareness. With investors already confronting the financial consequences of ecological instability – from stranded agricultural assets to declining sovereign-credit ratings in climate-vulnerable economies – there can be no doubt that nature risk is financial risk. Asset owners, central banks, and institutions like the IMF now have a responsibility to integrate this recognition into all their activities – before the next preventable shock materializes. The institutions that lead will be those willing to move beyond silos, align capital with planetary boundaries, and invest not only in markets, but also in the systems that support them.

Jul 24, 2025 Howard Davies Just four years ago, the world's banks, insurers, and asset managers were pledging to align their operations with the goal of achieving net-zero emissions, in order to mitigate the risks to financial stability posed by climate change. Now, however, those pledges have been sharply curtailed, owing to US pressure since January. EDINBURGH – At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), back in 2021, Mark Carney bestrode the financial world like a colossus. Now Canada’s prime minister, thanks in large part to US President Donald Trump’s call to make the country America’s 51st state, in 2021 he was the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. At COP26, Carney announced the creation of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), the parent of three precocious children, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), and the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. All that amounted to a whole lot of zeros, in the view of some sceptics, but Carney assured an e pectant world that “It’s not blah blah blah,” and that net zero would form the “critical infrastructure of the new financial system.” So, how well has the Glasgow initiative aged? At which end of the critical infrastructure-blah blah blah spectrum do we find ourselves? The intervening years have not been kind to the alphabet soup Carney cooked up. At the beginning of this year, the biggest US banks – JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and the rest – pulled out of the NZBA, clearly fearing political pressure from Trump’s new administration. The big US banks were soon followed by the Canadian banks, showing little loyalty to their future prime minister’s creation. In April, the remaining members watered down the initial commitments, focusing on alignment with a ma imum 2º Celsius temperature rise, rather than the long mooted 1.5ºC, and abandoning the target of full net-zero compliance by 2050. But that did not stem the flow of departures. Earlier this month, HSBC announced its defection, and it seems highly likely that others will do likewise. Today the members represent only a little over half the assets of the founders, but there are still some committed banks, and the NZBA remains alive.

Subscribe Now That is more than can be said for its little sister, the NZIA. Even before Trump’s election, some attorneys general from Republican-controlled states, raising concerns about collaborative climate pledges, had targeted the major members on antitrust grounds. Their motives might have been rather different, but legally they had a point. The founders had not properly thought through the implications of the pledges they were making. After a spate of withdrawals, in April 2024 the NZIA collapsed. There has been a replacement of sorts, in the form of the Forum for Insurance Transition to Net Zero . The forum’s membership obligations are more fle ible, and there are no targets or reporting obligations. It also claims to have armed itself with in-house lawyers to guard against any potential future contraventions of antitrust law. To complete the set, the third child, the NZAM, also e perienced a spate of withdrawals in January, led by BlackRock. That led to a suspension of its activities, and the removal of its published list of signatories. It is not clear when, if ever, the suspension will be lifted. We have accounted for the children, but what about the parent? GFANZ still technically e ists, but has been substantially remodeled. It now describes itself as an independent “Principals Group” with no pre-entry qualifications, and has shifted its focus from being a net-zero gatekeeper to becoming a facilitator of finance to fund the energy transition – a worthy task, but far from what was initially envisaged. It is hard to see these developments, taken together, as anything other than a significant watering down of the financial sector’s commitment to supporting the green transition. But where are the regulators, who were e erting pressure on their charges to step up and ensure that they were part of the climate-change solution, rather than being casualties of the problem? The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) was created by a coalition of eight willing central banks in 2017. The coalition included the United Kingdom, France, and China, but not the United States. After Joe Biden ’s election in 2020, the Federal Reserve, which prides itself on its political independence, decided to join, only to withdraw earlier this year. But in this case, other central banks remain committed. Some, like the Bank of England, have de-emphasized their climate stress-tests, but NGFS members, now numbering some 140, still believe that rising average temperatures threaten economic disruption, and that the energy transition will create winners and losers. Recent analysis by the NGFS suggests that the economic risks are greater than previously thought. If banks and insurers do not understand the implications, they may be adversely affected, adding financial instability to the other threats we face. It would be idle to imagine, though, that the rest of the world can continue as before. There are unmistakable signs that the US is putting pressure on international regulatory bodies to downgrade their climate-related work. The last communiqué from the Financial Stability Board noted that “while many members feel there is a need for more work, some feel that the work completed to date is sufficient,” and it seems that the “some” have dominated the “many.” Similarly, the Basel Committee has downgraded its work on climate-related disclosures and removed any requirement to comply. The Basel Committee did refuse a US request to disband its climate task force, but the US representatives reportedly simply do not turn up, which clearly impacts its effectiveness. So, where do we go from here? All the scientific evidence suggests that the impact of global warming on the financial sector is growing relentlessly, but US resistance to any resulting action by firms or their regulators is becoming firmer. The outcome of a clash between an irresistible force and an immovable object is notoriously hard to predict. In this case, my bet is on the irresistible force. A bad outcome, perhaps first in the insurance world, will illustrate the importance of shoring up our defenses. But even then, non-US regulators need to keep up the pressure.

Governor Barr's remarks on financial inclusion were updated on July 15, 2025, to add and remove language inadvertently omitted and included in the published version. Thank you, Eric; thank you to the Fed staff who have organized this second annual financial inclusion conference; and thank you all for being here.1 I have long believed that financial inclusion is a crucial component of a safe and fair financial system. Working to improve financial inclusion has been an important part of my career, starting in 1995 when I joined the Treasury Department and worked with colleagues to build Community Development Financial Institutions, strengthen the Community Reinvestment Act, and launch the New Markets initiative. At the University of Michigan, financial inclusion was key to programs I worked on to support minority entrepreneurship. With the support of both the public and private sectors, there have been many improvements and advancements in financial inclusion over the last three decades, evidenced by the decline in the rate of people who are unbanked and the increasing reach and success of programs such as the Bank On initiative that better meet the needs of low-income customers. I welcome this progress, but there is so much more to do to deepen and widen financial inclusion to many millions of people in America who could benefit from it. Better access to affordable financial services, geared to the needs of underserved families and entrepreneurs can help them to build more secure lives, stronger communities, and a stronger American economy. Financial inclusion contributes to the Federal Reserve's mission of promoting a healthy and growing economy and a safe and stable financial system. Consumers are two-thirds of economic activity, so access to credit for low-and-moderate income households and small businesses helps the economy to grow. In addition, the Fed has an important role in implementing a series of laws passed by Congress related to access to credit, such as the Community Reinvestment Act. As we learned during the Global Financial Crisis, household finances are crucial to a strong and stable financial system. In my remarks today, I would like to go through several ways that the public and private sectors are helping to increase financial inclusion. Those efforts include greater access to bank accounts and financial services, faster payments services, responsible small-dollar lending methods, and the use of alternative data to promote credit access. These efforts have shown promise in e panding financial inclusion. Bank Account Access Is the Foundation to Financial InclusionFinancial inclusion begins with access to basic bank account services. While financial services are evolving rapidlyâwith new forms of financial intermediation, payment services, and even deposit-like money claimsâit is still the case that access to a bank account is the foundation for helping families and businesses get the financial services they need. Bank accounts provide access to direct deposit of paychecks, benefit payments and ta refunds. Bank accounts provide connections to peer-to-peer payment systems, and for the vast majority of retail and wholesale payments. Bank accounts are also often the entry point for access to credit for households and businesses. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's 2023National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, the number of Americans without bank accounts is at the lowest it has been since the survey began in 2009. Yet, there remain groups that struggle with low account access, including those who are disabled, those without a high school diploma, and minority groups, among others. Households that include someone of working age with a disability are three times as likely to be unbanked as working-age households without a disability. Meanwhile, Hispanic and African American households and American Indian and Alaskan Native households are five and si times as likely, respectively, to be unbanked as White households.2The unbanked cite account opening costs, unpredictable or high fees, and high minimum balance requirements as among the top reasons for not obtaining bank accounts.3 E pansion of Banking AccessOne private-sector program that has helped to address barriers to account access is the Bank On program, supported by the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFEF). Bank On is led by coalitions of regional financial institutions, community groups, and local governments working together to bring households into the financial system. CFEF certifies that Bank On accounts meet standards including low minimum deposits for account opening; low maintenance, overdraft, or other une pected fees; and free branch ATM, online, and mobile banking. Over 46,000 bank branches nationwide offer a certified Bank On account. An important way that the program has spread and taken root in communities is through the coalition model, which involves establishing relationships with local and state governments, public officials, and community organizations. These partners, engaged with and trusted by their communities, have helped overcome apprehension about bank accounts and helped drive the outreach needed for any business to find new customers. The Federal Reserve System has long been a partner of the Bank On Initiative. In 2006, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco was a partner in creating the first coalition. At the St. Louis Fed, the publicly available Bank On National Data Hub (BOND) was created in 2017 to help identify the availability of certified accounts. Bank On coalitions across the country continue to partner on engagement, outreach, and data collection with their regional Reserve Banks, to offer safe and affordable bank accounts. Faster PaymentsFinancial inclusion also requires timely access to funds. People living paycheck to paycheck incur the greatest costs of waiting for these funds. One of the primary benefits of a bank account over time is facilitating payments. Technological advances have driven improvement in this area, sometimes only incrementally, but the more recent advent of real-time paymentsâespecially new services for instant or immediate paymentsâhas the potential to make a big leap forward in service to households and businesses. Cash-strapped households and businesses need access to their funds right away, and they need reliable ways to pay e penses when they are due (and when they have the funds to pay them). Low-income households may need quick access to make just-in-time transactions, such as same-day utility bill payment through their bank or to quickly receive funds from a family member to cover an emergency e pense like an unanticipated car repair. While the benefits of getting instantaneous access to paychecks are obvious, the value of controlling precisely when and in what order payments settle may be less appreciated. With real-time payments, households and businesses can have better control over payment flows, helping them, for e ample, to avoid une pected and unwelcome overdraft and nonsufficient funds fees. Many other countries are seeking methods to improve the speed of payments. In India, for e ample, the implementation of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which is the country's digital instant funds transfer system, has allowed consumers to see some of these benefits in action. UPI is available for free on a customer's mobile device and can be used for merchant payments, bill payments, and money transfers, among other things. Since its implementation, the Reserve Bank of India has noted an increase in financial inclusion, particularly in rural areas where bank branch access is difficult.4 We have seen the benefits of technological advancement and innovation here in the U.S. as well. Today, technologies to improve the speed of payments are being implemented across platforms and products, providing consumers various ways to move money quickly and easily. The Federal Reserve, as a part of its mission to foster a safe, efficient, and widely accessible payments infrastructure, is playing a role as well. As we have in the past, and in collaboration with the private sector, we have worked to innovate the payment system using the latest technology to better meet the needs of businesses and households. In 2023, we launched FedNow, an interbank payment system for banks and credit unions of all sizes to instantly and securely transfer money for their customers, any time of the day, on any day of the year.5We are encouraged by innovative private-sector engagement with the new platform and instant payment services generally. We are already seeing early adopters rolling out new services that can benefit consumers. One e ample is the ability for gig-economy workers to gain instant access to earned wages, which can make a big difference in household cash flow management. We e pect these types of innovations will continue to e pand in the coming years and be delivered in new conte ts, ultimately bringing broad benefits to liquidity-constrained households and small businesses that need to tightly manage payment inflows and outflows. Small-Dollar LendingAccess to small-dollar loans from banks can help consumers smooth through the ups and downs of income and e penses. I think many people would be surprised how widely this help is needed. According to the Fed's 2024 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, when asked how they would respond if confronted with an une pected $400 e pense, nearly 20 percent of adults said they would have paid at least in part by selling something; using a payday loan, deposit advance, or overdraft; or would not be able to pay for the e pense. When looking at households with incomes of under $25,000, this number increases to 46 percent.6Access to reasonably priced credit to cover these sorts of e penses is therefore a common need, especially among those with lower incomes. These households have no financial slack. In contrast to the more costly and riskier sources of credit that I mentioned, we are seeing bank-offered products that are helping to increase access to safer, lower-cost forms of small-dollar lending. The Fed and other bank regulators took a helpful step in this regard in 2020 by issuing guidance. According to that guidance, responsible small-dollar loan programs must treat customers fairly, have effectively managed risks, and be underwritten based on prudent policies. That means, first, that products are offered in a way that most customers successfully repay their small-dollar loans in accordance with original loan terms, which is a key indicator of affordability, eligibility, and appropriate underwriting. Second, it means repayment terms, pricing, and safeguards minimize adverse customer outcomes, including cycles of debt due to rollovers or reborrowing. And finally, it means repayment outcomes and program structures enhance a borrower's financial capabilities by contributing positively to their record of servicing debts. Most banks that have offered small-dollar loan products since 2020 follow these principles, and it has had a positive impact on the loan terms they offer. Loan terms have better matched customer needs and rates have come down. Small-dollar loans that have the potential to disrupt the market for costly alternative financial services are bank products that provide a straightforward application process, clear loan terms, certainty about approval, strong likelihood of repayment, and quick disbursement of funds.7 Alternative Financial DataAnother channel for improving financial inclusion is the use of alternative financial data to supplement the traditional measures that banks have relied on to judge the creditworthiness of borrowers with limited or no traditional borrowing history. For e ample, lenders can evaluate cash flowâsteady income and bill paymentsâas a measure of the likelihood of loan repayment. Alternative data can help lenders take a \"second look\" for consumers who would otherwise not qualify based on the more traditional credit-score-based underwriting models. In addition to making less e pensive and more suitable loans available, alternative data often allows faster loan decisions. This is an important consideration for low- and moderate-income borrowers, who tend to have little savings, and struggle with meeting an une pected e pense.8Technological advances such as application programming interfaces (APIs), a set of specifications that can allow software to communicate with each other, can also help lenders access permissioned consumer financial data that can be used for underwriting. APIs also facilitate automated application, decisionmaking, and fund delivery. Let me conclude by returning to where I started, which is the crucial role of access to safe, transparent, and low-cost bank accounts as the gateway to financial inclusion. We have made great progress, but I am certain that there are still many people whose finances and lives could improve with a bank account suited to their needs and economic circumstances. I applaud the work of financial inclusion leaders in doing what they can to make bank accounts available and better tailored to the needs of low- and moderate-income households. In thinking about how to better design financial products and services, we can build on many years of behavioral financial research and practice. Thank you. 1.

Good morning. I'm very pleased to welcome you to the second annual Financial Inclusion Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Board.1Last year, at our inaugural event, I underscored that financial inclusion is essential for creating an economy that works for everyone, with innovation in the financial sector playing an important role.2 This year's conference builds upon increased engagement across both the public and private sectors, with a collective effort to leverage technology to broaden financial service access and improve the financial well-being of consumers and small businesses. The Federal Reserve will continue to play an important role in these efforts through its research, community engagement, and regulatory approach. This work supports our ability to understand and communicate the state of financial inclusion, how banks support access to affordable financial services, and the role that our policies and practices play in promoting inclusion. Progress to DateBanks of all sizes are working to improve access to financial services for all Americans. As I've noted in the past, the U.S. banking system is well-positioned to bring consumers and small businesses into the financial mainstream by providing access to safe, fair, and responsive financial products and services.3These efforts greatly benefit from our continued focus on broader access and innovation, including understanding how our supervisory and regulatory framework either supports or impairs a bank's ability to provide affordable financial services that are consistent with safety and soundness. Innovation comes in many forms. One e ample is through banks' use of alternative data, which can enable banks to provide services like affordable small-dollar loans or to provide access to credit invisibles who may not have access to loans and other financial services from traditional lenders.4This growing area of focus also helps align financial service offerings with a customer's financial goals. A well-functioning financial system provides a foundation for strong consumer financial health. To further this, the federal banking agencies recently published a request for information on check and payments fraud to help address the impact of this growing problem on banks and their customers. I am committed to working together with a wide range of state and federal partners, including law enforcement, to address this issue.5 A More Financially Inclusive FutureAlthough there has been significant progress in providing access to financial services, there is more work left to be done. We know that financial institutions, both small and large, are working to build innovative approaches to meet their customers' needs while maintaining the safety and soundness of the banking system. Today's ConferenceThe theme of this year's conference is \"Unleashing a Financially Inclusive Future.\" Today, we will hear from a number of experts that will help to explore what the future might hold for financial inclusion. Our next presenter, Jo Ann Barefoot from the Alliance for Innovative Regulation, will discuss the role of banking industry innovation and policies in support of financial inclusion. Later in the day we will hear from three panels focused on topics including evolving products and practices, the role of mission-driven organizations, and how cross-border payment innovations can facilitate the movement of money around the world. I would like to thank you all for joining us today and I will turn it over to Art Lindo, Deputy Director and Head of Policy in the Board's Division of Supervision & Regulation, to introduce Jo Ann Barefoot. Thank you for the opportunity to join you virtually today, and for your ongoing commitment to support a financially inclusive future. 1.

At the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Dallas, Te as Thank you, Lorie. Let me start by e pressing my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those harmed by the flooding in the Hill Country. I cannot imagine the pain and anguish they are feeling. My prayers go out to all those affected. Turning to my remarks for today, thank you also for the opportunity to speak to you about the Fed's balance sheet, one of the more comple , and, I believe, misunderstood aspects of the Federal Reserve's role as a central bank.1To level set the conversation, let me start with some simple facts. In August of 2007 our balance sheet was around $870 billion, equal to appro imately 6 percent of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). Today it is around $6.7trillion, with at, which is about 22 percent of GDP. This is down significantly from its ma imum size of nearly $9 trillion in early 2022 but still quite large. Since nominal GDP has essentially doubled since 2007, if our balance sheet had grown at the same rate, it would be around $1.7 trillion todayânot $6.7 trillion. An obvious question is why our balance sheet is so much larger than economic growth would have predicted. As an aside, let me point out that there is no consensus among economists about how large a central bank balance sheet should be, but it is logical to ask: if monetary policy worked when the balance sheet was 6 percent of GDP, why is it, and perhaps needs to be, proportionally so much larger now? A major reason is that the Federal Reserve embarked on two major balance sheet policy initiatives over the past twenty years to respond to urgent problems in the economy. First, we engaged in quantitative easing, or QE, to provide support to the economy after the advent of the Global Financial Crisis and then again with the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we consciously changed our implementation framework for providing liquidity to the banking system by moving from a scarce-reserves system to an ample-reserves system. This change was necessary because there were shortcomings with the scarce-reserves approachâshort-term rates were harder to control and required daily interventions in the markets by the Fed, and these problems were made worse when rates were at or near zero. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) e plicitly stated its commitment to ample reserves in 2019, when we were gradually shrinking our balance sheet, concluding that this approach would be used over the longer-run, and it soon proved very useful when the pandemic again brought rates to zero.2 Although these are two fundamentally different reasons for changing the size of our balance sheet, we did them more or less at the same time. This has caused confusion, with some people thinking that the Fed is choosing to keep the balance sheet larger than it needs to be. This confusion is amplified by the fact that there are e ternal forces that have boosted the size of our balance sheet that are not under the control of the Federal Reserve. My goal today in this speech is to disentangle each of these forces and try to demystify the role of our balance sheet in conducting monetary policy. I also want to clarify issues that are currently being discussed in the public domain. I agree that the balance sheet needs to shrink but, as I will show, not by as much as some believe it should. I will also e plain why the composition of the balance sheet matters as much as its size and how changes are needed there as well. I know from teaching this topic over the years to my undergraduate students that unless you are an accountant or a banker, you would probably rather go to the dentist than listen to a speech about the Fed's balance sheet. I hope to e plain it clearly enough that you can leave here and engage in the public debate with a better understanding of the issues. To do so, the approach I want to take is the following. Suppose the Fed had never used quantitative easing and simply decided to move to an ample-reserves system from a scarce-reserves system. How would the liability and asset sides of our balance sheet change in response to this one policy decision? After addressing this question, I will then discuss how QE affects our balance sheet and also some difficult tradeoffs that arise when engaging in QE. The Big Three LiabilitiesFor any balance sheet, we start with the asset and liability entries. Assets are things that are owned, and liabilities are things that are owed to others at a given point in time. I will start by listing the big three liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet and the characteristics of those liabilities. There are other types of liabilities (and capital) that must be accounted for, but they are too small to matter for the policy matters I want to discuss, so I will ignore them. After discussing these \"big three\" liabilities, we can consider what assets should be held to match those liabilities. The first big liability of the Federal Reserve is currency outstanding. The Fed supplies U.S. dollars elastically to the public, based on demand, distributing dollars through banks.3That demand, which is not controlled by the Fed, is basically determined by how fast the economyâand thus the need for cashâis growing. At the end of 2024, the amount of dollars in circulation was $2.3 trillion. That is up considerably from around $800 billion in 2007 after which the overall balance sheet began growing sharply. Even in terms of GDP, currency has increased, from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to almost 8 percent today. So, an important point that many do not realize is that the Fed's balance sheet has e panded, especially in nominal terms, from increased demand for U.S. currency.4 What are the characteristics of currency as a liability? First, it is non-interest bearing. Second, it never \"matures\" as other debt obligations do. Let's just say that currency is different from other liabilitiesâit pays no interest, and you never get back your initial payment for acquiring it. If you come to the Fed and ask us to redeem a dollar bill, we will simply give you another dollar bill. The second big liability is the Treasury General Account, or TGA. The Federal Reserve is the fiscal agent of the U.S. Treasury, which means that we are the bank for the U.S. government and the TGA is the Treasury's checking account. What are the characteristics of the TGA? First, it is a short-term liability that moves up and down as cash flows in and out of the account as the Treasury receives ta and other payments and pays its bills. Second, we do not pay interest to the Treasury on its account balances. Finally, given the asynchronous timing of payments and receipts, the TGA can vary significantly, especially when the debt ceiling is binding. During 2024, it generally fluctuated between about $650 billion and $950 billion, briefly peaking at around $960 billion during the April ta season. Due to this year's debt ceiling constraint, the TGA fell from its 2024 average of $780 billion to about $325 billion recently, and with the debt ceiling just increased, there will be a quick rebuild in the coming weeks. So, it is not unusual for the TGA to fluctuate by several hundred billion dollars. This situation is very different than the one in 2007 when the TGA was deliberately held steady at $5 billion each day. This change reflects both how much federal spending has grown in that time and also a shift in accounting in 2015 to holding an estimated week's worth of federal payments in the TGAâa decision made by the Treasury to better manage its cash flow. An important point that applies to both currency and the TGA is that the Federal Reserve does not have control over the size of these liabilities and hasn't been responsible for their sharp increases. Together, they represent about $3 trillion of our $6.7 trillion balance sheet, or roughly 10 percent of nominal gross domestic product. So, the size of the Fed's balance sheet, which is now about 22 percent of nominal GDP, is nearly half accounted for by these two liabilities that are not under the Fed's control. Those who argue that the Fed could go back to 2007, when its total balance sheet was 6 percent of GDP, fail to recognize that these two factors make it impossible. The third big liability on the Fed's balance sheet is reserves, which are the funds that depository institutions hold in accounts at the Fed. In effect, these are the checking account balances of the banking system that are held at the Federal Reserve. What is the characteristic of reserves held by banks? First, much like the TGA, they are short term in nature and very liquidâin effect like digital cash. They are the safest and most liquid asset in the financial system and used to conduct payments between banks. The reserve balances that an individual bank holds can increase or decrease, depending on the flow of payments between banks. Much like the TGA, an individual bank's reserve holdings can be volatile. But these payments do not change the total amount of reserves in the banking systemâthey simply transfer them from one bank to another. So, while reserve balances of individual banks can move around, total reserves are more stable, and the total amount of reserves in the system is directly controlled by the Federal Reserve. Second, in October 2008, Congress authorized the Federal Reserve to pay interest on these liabilities. Besides ending the implicit ta on banks for holding reserves, it was a step aimed at helping the Fed conduct monetary policy effectively, which it does, but it is sometimes inaccurately criticized as a giveaway to banks. I will address this point a little later. But I mention it here because the amount of reserves in the system affects the total payment flow the Fed must make to banks at the current interest rate on reserves. Assets Backing These LiabilitiesBy the definition of a balance sheet, these liabilities must be matched by assets held by the Federal Reserve. Let's consider matching assets to our currency liability. As I said earlier, currency pays no interest and never matures. So, we can hold assets of any maturity length to offset our liability for currency. Since currency pays no interest, any interest earned off these assets is pure profit. Given that longer-maturity assets generally pay higher interest rates and are less volatile, it seems reasonable to hold longer maturity assets against our currency liability. Now consider the TGA liability. We also pay no interest on the TGA. But, unlike currency, a problem with the TGA is that it can vary substantially, which makes total reserves in the system more volatile. This link to reserves is because when ta payments are made to the Treasury, we debit the payer's bank reserves and credit the Treasury's TGA account. When the Treasury makes a payment, we debit the TGA and credit the recipient bank's reserve account. Thus, volatile movements in the TGA affect the Fed's reserve management policy. There are two ways to deal with this situation: hold a buffer of reserves to ensure movements in the TGA do not affect market liquidity or hold short-maturity assets that we can e pand or contract to sterilize movements in the TGA such that total reserves in the banking system are unchanged.5The first strategy suggests the buffer stock of assets could take the form of somewhat longer maturity, while the second strategy could require holding short-term assets that can easily be bought and sold with little interest rate risk. That brings us to reserves. As I mentioned, reserves are a short-maturity liability which pay interest, which suggests that the Fed should consider holding short maturity assets against this liability. Treasury bills and short-maturity Treasury notes are the safest and most liquid assets, so it would make sense to hold them against reserves. If the interest rate earned on our short maturity Treasury assets is very close to the interest we pay on reserves, then our interest earnings from the Treasury are simply passed through to the banks. In this sense, our balance sheet is just another way to transfer interest payments on Treasury securities from the Treasury to the banks.6 Because of the minimal spread between these two short-term interest rates, banks are largely indifferent to either holding reserves or the short-term Treasury securities we holdâboth are highly liquid and pay roughly the same rate of return. But layer on top of this the fact that reserves are a bit more liquid than Treasury securities because banks don't have to buy or sell the Treasury securities to get reserves, and banks are willing to hold a lot of reserves. Since the Fed supplies these reserves, one might ask what it costs ta payers to supply a large amount of reserves. From the Treasury's point of view, its interest e pense is the same regardless of who holds the short-term Treasury securities. So, the Fed can provide all the liquidity that banks need at zero marginal cost, which makes me wonder why some want to make reserves scarce. I often use the following analogy to drive this point home: If governments could provide clean, safe drinking water for citizens at zero cost, why would they make it scarce? Now, one could ask why pay interest on reserves at all? Why not keep the interest income generated on the assets we hold to back reserves and remit it back to the Treasury? This seems like a no brainer! But there are a few reasons that interest on reserves makes sense, including the following. First, paying interest on reserves that is commensurate to the rate paid on short-term Treasury securities makes reserves attractive to banks, and holding reserves improves the functioning of the financial system by giving banks more liquidity and greater scope to settle payments in an orderly way. In contrast, if reserves bear no interest, then commercial banks will have strong incentives to avoid holding a lot of reserves, and instead hold short-term, interest-bearing assets like Treasury bills. If banks managed their liquidity only by buying and selling Treasury securities, several banks selling Treasury securities at the same time could flood the market and put undesirable upward pressure on interest rates across the economy. An ample-reserves regime where we pay interest on reserves ensures that there are enough reserves in the banking system to avoid this kind of sell off in Treasury securities, helping to stabilize the financial system without any harm to banks or their customers. The second part of the case for interest on reserves is that it isn't costing ta payers any money. As I noted earlier, whether the Fed or banks hold the Treasury securities, the Treasury is paying interest on its debt. And, if the Fed is holding the Treasury securities, then the interest payment from the Treasury to the Fed on the Treasury bills is matched with an interest payment from the Fed to banks on their reserves. So, paying interest on reserves is not creating any additional e pense to the Treasury. But what is the appropriate level of ample reserves the Fed is trying to get to? There is no clear answer to this question and that is what we are trying to discern. We want to provide the amount of liquidity necessary, but we don't want to provide e cessive liquidity that banks do not want or need. One reason for increased demand for reserves is that since the Global Financial Crisis changes in banking regulations led to a large shift in demand for high-quality liquid assets. For e ample, bank liquidity regulations, such as the liquidity coverage ratio, encouraged banks to hold high quality liquid assets. As these regulations came into play, banks' demand for high-quality liquid assets, including reserves, increased tremendously relative to 2007. I think of ample reserves as the threshold below which banks would need to scramble to find safe, liquid funding, something that would drive up the federal funds rate and money market interest rates across the economy. We have some e perience with testing the level of ample reserves during an episode of stress in the financial system that occurred in 2019. At the start of that year, reserves stood at about 8 percent of nominal GDP, and we were continuing to reduce our balance sheet with no apparent stress among banks or otherwise in the financial system. In September 2019, reserves fell below 7 percent of nominal GDP, and stresses appeared in the financial system, requiring the Fed to step in and take action to add reserves. So, I start from the view that problems emerged when reserves fell below 8 percent of GDP. One might argue that banks are now larger relative to GDP, so they may desire a bit more reserves. Furthermore, there is also a genuine concern that it is not only the total amount of reserves that matters but also the distribution of reserves across the banking system. So, I would add a buffer to the 8 percent of GDP that I cited earlier and assume 9 percent is the threshold below which reserves would not be ample. That would mean, as of today, that $2.7 trillion of reserves is roughly ampleâit could be more or less in practice, but let me use it as a benchmark. So, putting the pieces of this hypothetical minimum balance sheet together, we have an estimated $2.7 trillion in reserve balances, $2.3 trillion in currency, and an average of $780 billion in TGA liabilities. This combined means the Fed should be operating with a balance sheet that is roughly $5.8 trillion dollars or 19 percent of GDP. Close to half of this proportional increase from 2007, as I noted, comes from currency and TGA growth outside the Fed's control, and the rest from a transition to an ample reserves regime that has been a necessary, efficient and more effective way of managing monetary policy. In summary, if we had simply adopted an ample reserves system and backed these liabilities as I suggested without engaging in quantitative easing, there are three key takeaways: (1) we would be earning a net profit off of the assets backing currency and the TGA, (2) the assets backing ample reserves would simply be a way to transfer interest payments to the banks, and (3) we would hold short to medium term assets that could be bought or sold to neutralize large movements in the TGA to keep total reserves stable. With this balance sheet, the Federal Reserve would never run losses, the banks would have ample liquidity for market functioning, and the Fed would not face serious interest rate risk on its asset holdings. Today's Balance Sheet and Where We Are HeadingAt this point there are going to be people somewhere shaking their fists and yelling that what I have said is simply false because the Federal Reserve is currently losing money on its balance sheet. Our interest e pense on reserves is now e ceeding our interest income on our asset holdings. This is all true. But this outcome is because of engaging in QE for many years since 2007, not because we are running an ample reserves system. Remember, what I have described so far is what an optimally designed balance sheet would look like if we had never engaged in QE and simply moved to an ample-reserves system. Let me now do the following. Assume we have a balance sheet that corresponds to an ample-reserves system, but now the Fed engages in QE as a means of conducting monetary policy to support the economy. The Federal Reserve engaged in QE programs when the policy rate was driven down to zero because of severe shocks to the economy after the Global Financial Crisis and then because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Once the policy rate is at zero, the Federal Reserve is constrained in its ability to use its traditional tools to provide further support for the economy. The idea of QE is to buy longer-duration securities as opposed to short-duration assets. By increasing the demand for long-dated securities, the Fed drives up the price and drives down the yield on those securities. By lowering longer-term yields the Fed is able to loosen financing conditions to stimulate aggregate demand. The Fed typically buys longer-dated Treasury securities during QE, but it also bought agency mortgage-backed securities that have the implicit backing of the U.S. Treasury and are issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored enterprises. QE affects our balance sheet in material ways that differ from what happens if one is simply constructing the balance sheet to support ample reserves, currency, and the TGA. First, it increases the duration of our balance sheet beyond what we would hold just for currency. Longer-duration assets are more prone to interest rate risk, and the lower the interest rates on those assets, the lower interest income the Fed will receive far into the future. If interest rates rise suddenly or over time as the economy recovers, those assets lose value (in substantial amounts), which lowers the unrealized value of our portfolio. Second, we use short-term reserves to buy the longer duration assets which leads to a maturity mismatch between our assets and our liabilities. So, the additional reserves that are injected from QE may not be costless when short-term rates rise, as they did in 2022, meaning that interest paid on those additional reserves will e ceed what is earned on the long-term assets that were purchased with them. This effect highlights the fact that engaging in QE involves a tradeoff for the Federal Reserveâtrying to support the economy in serious economic downturns at the zero lower bound while creating a maturity mismatch between our assets and liabilities that brings interest rate risk onto our balance sheet. This tradeoff does not happen if we simply structure our balance sheet to support an ample-reserves system. The decision to engage in QE requires the Federal Reserve to weigh the benefits and costs from this action. Those benefits and costs are often difficult to quantify at the time QE is undertaken. It is only with hindsight that we can fully assess them, which is one of the challenges of making policy in real time. Where do we stand today? The Federal Reserve is operating with an abundant, or more than ample, level of reserves, and our securities holdings are tilted toward longer-dated maturities. We are shrinking the balance sheet to get back to a size consistent with an ample reserves system. As of last month, banks had nearly $3.4 trillion of reserves with the Fed, accounting for about 11 percent of nominal GDP.7Given my rough estimate of the level of reserves needed to be ample, I believe we can likely continue to let a share of maturing and prepaying securities roll off our balance sheet for some time, reducing reserve balances. Of course, we will continue to carefully monitor financial markets as we go. For me, the bigger problem with our balance sheet is that the maturity structure of our assets to support an ample-reserves system is not well matched. We have far too many long-term assets on our balance sheet relative to my arguments for how to structure the balance sheet. I argued that long-term assets should only be held against currency liabilities, which are $2.3 trillion. But we hold about $2.3 trillion in agency mortgage-backed securities alone! So the duration of our asset portfolio is far too long for the liabilities we need to hold for an ample-reserves system. If the Fed moved forward with a maturity-matching strategy as I suggest, it would hold about half of its Treasury securities in shorter-dated bills. There have been some advocates who support moving toward the Federal Reserve having a Treasury securities portfolio whose composition mimics the breakdown, or \"universe,\" of total Treasury securities outstanding. This would mean having about 20 percent of our current balance sheet in bills. The argument for this maturity structure is that with this approach, the Fed's holdings would not be putting pressure on any one segment of the yield curve. This is a valid argument, but it would put more duration on our balance sheet and e pose the Fed to potential income losses, as we have witnessed the past few years. Maybe that is a tradeoff we should make to avoid distorting our demand for Treasury securities relative to the market's demand. In the end, I support continuing the conversation about what the ultimate composition should be. My objective today was to try to clarify what an ample-reserves balance sheet should look like as a starting point for this conversation. In the years ahead, moving our portfolio toward shorter-duration securities will be a slow process unless we were to take the dramatic step of selling existing securities to replace them with Treasury bills. When reserves hit their desired ample level and we need to increase securities holdings in line with growth in autonomous factors, like currency and the TGA, we can actively accumulate bills, if we do not take other actions sooner. I hope that taking a deep dive into a few line items on the Fed's balance sheet has helped to see some issues that lie ahead. Though the FOMC has not finalized its desired efficient and effective size and composition of the balance sheet, it seems apparent that today's portfolio should be adjusted. And there are obvious steps to take. We are reducing the size of the balance sheet slowly and need to consider shifting it toward more bills. As we do so, we should do it gradually and predictably, so the markets and public are fully aware of our actions. 1.

The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, provides the nation with a safe, fle ible, and stable monetary and financial system. At the Policy Summit 2025: Building Strong and Sustainable Communities, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio Thank you, Eric, thank you to the conference organizers for asking me to speak today, and thank you, especially, to the practitioners here for the work you do in building stronger communities.1Your mission has also been at the center of my career in many different roles as an academic, a practitioner, and a public official, starting as the Treasury Department's point person on community development way back in the 1990s. Community development has been an important part of my work ever since, as a professor, a university leader, and, most recently, a banking regulator. I think this might help you understand how thrilled I am to have recently taken on the role of consumer and community development point person among the members of the Board of Governors, in support of Eric and his team and of the CD function throughout the Fed System. Strong and sustainable communities are crucial to the Federal Reserve's mission of promoting a healthy economy and a stable financial system. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the Fed has a statutory obligation to supervise how banks meet the credit needs of the communities they serve, consistent with safe and sound lending practices. Our community development work reinforces the benefits of this effort. More broadly, community development work helps the Fed support a strong and healthy economy. Our primary tool for doing this is monetary policy. Monetary policy influences interest rates and financial conditions to affect economic activity. We adjust interest rates in service of seeking price stability and ma imum employment for the American people. Let me spend just a moment on the U.S. economy and the outlook. The economy is currently on a sound footing, with low and steady unemployment, and disinflation having continued at a gradual, albeit uneven, pace toward our 2 percent target. Low-income households can ill afford increases in prices, and that's why it is so important that we bring inflation back down to our target. Looking forward, however, I e pect tariffs will put upward pressure on inflation. Higher short-term inflation expectations, supply chain adjustments, and second-round effects may cause some inflation persistence. At the same time, tariffs may cause the economy to slow and unemployment to rise. Low-income workers are often hit the hardest when the job market weakens. There is still considerable uncertainty about tariff policies and their effects. Monetary policy is well positioned to allow us to wait and see how economic conditions unfold. Turning from monetary policy to community development, let me e plain how community development also serves the goals of supporting a healthy economy that works for all Americans. While monetary policy matters a lot, other factors have to come together for people to have good job opportunities. Businesses need access to credit to e pand and hire, and in many communities that credit depends on the CRA, community development financial institutions, and a range of other public policies. Businesses need qualified workers, and in many places that depends on workforce development that is supported by community development organizations. Businesses that invest to create jobs need to believe in the future and believe in the future of the communities they serve. Thriving businesses and productive workers need safe, healthy, strong, and sustainable communities. These conditions are fundamental to achieving the Federal Reserve's goals that Congress has established. In Every CommunityThat is a big reason why the Fed's community development function is such an important part of the Federal Reserve System. Getting monetary policy decisions right requires a deep understanding of the conditions of local economies across the nation. This need is one of the reasons that the Fed was designed as an institution with a presence in every region of the country, ensuring that the e periences and perspectives of people from everywhere are considered in the decisions we make. It is why the Federal Reserve is actively seeking input from the public in formulating our long-term goals and strategy for monetary policy, with listening sessions around the country, including one right here at the Cleveland Fed. We want to hear from as many communities as we can, and an important way to do that is through our long-standing connections to organizations that are supporting strong and sustainable communities. In addition to the work you do, we value your perspectives, especially on how low- and moderate-income communities are faring in the economy. Federal Reserve policymakers depend on a lot of data, such as the unemployment rate, in making our decisions, but numbers can only go so far, and we also rely on actual e periences, on the ground, of people like you and those you serve. Beyond providing insights on economic conditions, the Fed's community development function supports the economy by promoting access to credit and other financial services among small businesses and low- and moderate-income households and communities. This access is a cornerstone of economic opportunity and resiliency. By analyzing and disseminating information on local financial needs and highlighting successful approaches for attracting and deploying capital, the Fed's community development work advances economic vitality in communities across America. The Fed staff who work on community development also work closely with the supervisors overseeing bank compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. By ensuring that these two functions are working together, we can support financial institutions' awareness of promising opportunities to meet their obligations under the CRA. Beyond supporting these statutory obligations, the insights gathered by the Fed's CD function serve as an early warning system of risks in the financial system. CD programs help spot emerging trends that may, for e ample, reveal patterns of unfair treatment of borrowers or signal risks to the safety and soundness of lending practices in particular communities. What Makes Community Development WorkI've outlined the important role that support for community development plays at the Federal Reserve. Now I'd like to offer a few words on effective community developmentâwhat works, and some ideas for how it might work even better. While we have learned a great deal over the years about promoting healthy and vibrant people and places, there are substantial opportunities to e pand and adapt successful approaches to new areas. As an institution committed to conducting and disseminating high-quality, independent, and actionable research, the Federal Reserve will continue to conduct and support research on community development, and policymakers, including me, will highlight that research and engage with the public on new ideas for creating economic opportunity, particularly in low- and moderate-income communities. This includes conducting original quantitative research to shed new light on evolving challenges, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' recent research looking into the incidence of youth disconnection from the labor force and education, and how that differs across communities. As far as collecting data, I would also point to our Community Perspectives Survey and the Small Business Credit Survey, which the Cleveland Fed has conducted since 2020.2 Beyond collecting and analyzing data, the Federal Reserve's CD function also conducts qualitative research to understand the \"why\" behind the data. For e ample, the Philadelphia Fed recently published insights from their conversations with employers in the manufacturing as well as the leisure and hospitality sectors in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware on how they are addressing staffing challenges.3 Another way that the Fed helps advance knowledge is through convenings like the one we're a part of today. For e ample, the San Francisco Fed recently hosted the California Rural Success Summit, which aimed to connect rural stakeholders across the state and to showcase innovative efforts to enhance access to jobs and credit across rural California.4These convenings can also take the form of virtual events, such as the New York Fed's recent webinar e ploring local approaches to developing and rehabbing affordable apartments.5 These are a few of the ways that the Fed's community development work helps e pand knowledge across the field. Communities also need to know how to apply that knowledge and have access to the partners and resources needed to do so. The Federal Reserve's CD function convenes local stakeholders who have a common interest in looking for ways to create opportunities and partnerships to better serve community development needs. For e ample, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been supporting community leaders for more than a decade through its Working Places Initiative, which helps local leaders work together to build strong, healthy economies and communities.6Similarly, through the Advance Together initiative, the Dallas Fed supports local communities across the 11th District that are addressing education and employment challenges to connect more Te ans with quality jobs.7The Atlanta Fed helped to establish and continues to actively participate in the Metro Atlanta e change for Workforce Solutions, a connector for workforce developers in the area. MA , as it is known, helps bring together employers with those involved in training, apprenticeships, and certification programs to fill specific demands.8And, lastly, I would include the Occupational Mobility E plorer, an interactive tool developed by the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Philadelphia that allows workers to explore career paths and visualize how job skills can transfer to higher-paying occupations.9 Fed CD staff also help investors and community development organizations connect with each other to explore mutually beneficial opportunities to work together. Through initiatives like the Kansas City Fed's Investment Connection and the Richmond Fed's Rural Investment Collaborative, the Federal Reserve helps communities identify potential financing partners who can move their ideas to action.10 These are just some of the ways the Federal Reserve supports the work of community development practitioners, who, as I have described, in turn support the Federal Reserve's work of promoting a healthy economy and a safe and stable financial system. Thank you for the work you do and for sharing some time with me today as we work together now and into the future to achieve our community development goals. 1.

The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, provides the nation with a safe, fle ible, and stable monetary and financial system. At a Fed Listens event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Omaha, Nebraska Thank you, President Schmid, and thank you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for hosting this event.1The Federal Reserve, with its system of 12 distinct regional Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., was designed to ensure that monetary policy was a national decision with input from all parts of the country. The work of the District Reserve Banks, and events like this one, make sure that a wide range of views can inform President Schmid, me, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and all of our colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as we come together in Washington to set monetary policy. Let me spend just a moment on the economy and the outlook. The economy is currently on a sound footing, with low and steady unemployment, and disinflation having continued at a gradual, albeit uneven, pace toward our 2 percent target. Looking forward, however, I e pect inflation to rise due to tariffs. Higher short-term inflation expectations, supply chain adjustments, and second-round effects may cause some inflation persistence. At the same time, tariffs may cause the economy to slow and unemployment to rise. There is still considerable uncertainty about tariff policies and their effects. Monetary policy is well positioned to allow us to wait and see how economic conditions unfold. The broad objectives of monetary policy are clear and have been mandated by Congressâma imum employment and stable prices. Our strategy for getting there is laid out in the Fed's policy framework, which we plan to update later this year. And setting that strategy to reach our goals is informed by outreach like the session today. Monetary policy decisions affect everyone. Stable prices are important for families and businesses to be able to plan for the future, and for sustainable and healthy labor markets. When we get it right, we can help foster broad and inclusive employment gains that benefit the American people. Our decisions play a role, for e ample, in the prices for agricultural commodities that are particularly important for businesses and consumers in this region. These decisions affect the labor market, including the challenges that businesses can face in finding qualified workers, which I know is a bigger issue in Nebraska, with lower unemployment than in some other places. But the Federal Reserve's role is a limited oneâmost of what affects the economy are the individual decisions of households and businesses. The primary tool for monetary policy is short-term interest rates, which in turn can affect longer-term rates that you, your customers, and people in your communities pay to finance land and equipment and other inputs. Credit has always played a particularly important role in agriculture, so I know that interest rates matter a lot in this part of America. Let me emphasize that real-world rates are significantly affected by other forces in the economy, but Fed policy does play a role. Monetary policy sometimes requires tradeoffsâa stance of policy that is necessary to lower inflation, for e ample, may also lower aggregate demand and slow the economy. Crucial in balancing our economic goals is determining how policy decisions affect households and businesses, which is why we are here to listen to you. Businesses also have to balance their goals. Producers need to judge the strength of demand for their products and services, the trend in costs for their inputs, and the e pected future costs for credit. These and other factors affect how businesses see tradeoffs as they make decisions about e panding operations and hiring. Workers need to balance their prospects for their wages keeping up with inflation or whether it's worth moving to find a better job. Your e perience, and the e periences of your customers and the other people you serve, is an important input into the strategy the Fed will decide on for our long-term monetary policy framework. We are going to consider everything we've learned in the past five eventful years since we last updated our framework, and we have learned a lot. But we can't do it without you, because you are who we serve. And so, since listening requires that one stop talking, I am going to wrap up by thanking everyone from the Omaha area and across the 10th District for agreeing to be part of today's gathering. I look forward to hearing what you have to say. 1.

At a Fed Listens event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Schenectady, New York Thank you, President Williams. And thank you to everyone who took the time to join us here today to offer your feedback.1 It is my pleasure to be here in Albany, a region of the country that has been so critical to the growth of our nation's economy. One of the aspects I enjoy most about my job is having the opportunity to visit every region of the country and see how the economy is unfolding on the ground. I am happy to be able to do that again today. The purpose of thisFed Listensevent, specifically, is to receive your input as part of the public review of our long-run goals and strategy for monetary policy. We call this document our framework.2The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last reviewed this important document in 2019â2020. At that time Committee members decided it was appropriate to complete a similar review every five years. The 2025 review consists of three elements: a research conference, discussions and deliberations at our policy meetings, and, very importantly,Fed Listensevents such as this. As Chair Powell said last month, in this review we are reconsidering aspects of our strategic framework in light of the e perience of the last five years. I anticipate that consideration of changes to the framework, based on the information and perspectives gathered during this review, will be complete in coming months. As part of this process, I am paying particular attention to what we have learned about the economy in the past five years, and the way changes made in the last framework review were interpreted by the public. The Committee will also consider possible enhancements to the FOMC's policy communication tools. But, of course, I enjoy hearing from the public on a regular basis, not just as part of our framework review. Obtaining that on-the-ground insight is an essential ingredient to my approach in making policy. As a Fed policymaker, who is also an academic economist, I am always analyzing data to better understand how the economy is developing. However, I feel strongly that it is best to add to that technical training by hearing from people across the country, people like you. I am proud to say that I have visited nearly every Fed District during my relatively short time on the Board, and I have plans to see the remaining Districts in the near future. It is important to hear from Americans for whom we make policy. I want to listen to the perspective of families considering significant purchases and employment decisions. I want to hear from business owners about investment and hiring plans. I want local leaders to tell me about how their communities are faring. This information matters greatly to me as a policymaker. I thank you for taking the time to share your stories. Now the primary purpose of this event is for me and President Williams to listen to you, so I will stop here, and look forward to hearing from all of you. Thank you again. 1.

The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, provides the nation with a safe, fle ible, and stable monetary and financial system. Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle W. Bowman At âAssessing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic,â a research conference sponsored by the International Journal of Central Banking and the Czech National Bank, Prague, Czech Republic Thank you for the invitation to join you today.1As the Federal Reserve's Vice Chair for Supervision, I am responsible for, among other things, leading the Board's Division of Supervision and Regulation in its work to promote the safe and sound operation of the U.S. banking system. While this includes the specific activities of bank supervision and regulation, the financial system reaches far beyond the banking system. Regulators must also monitor the effects of activities that e tend outside this perimeter, for e ample activities that have migrated from banks to non-banks, or when there are broader market implications of regulatory actions and their potential effects on financial stability. Regulations should not be created in a static world of \"set it and forget it.\" Today, my remarks will focus specifically on how the passage of timeâwith underlying changes in the composition of the economy and the financial system, interest rate shifts, and patterns and preferences of banking and financial activityâcan lead to unintended policy application and une pected consequences. Regulators should consider these broader evolving dynamics as they craft regulations to endure beyond today's circumstances. Typically, these effects are not contemplated in the scope of the usual cost-benefit analysis, as shifts occur over time after a new rule or regulation is implemented or enacted. But shifts can, in effect, become new policy choices with consequences that can pose significant issues. One shift in particular is that of the supplementary leverage ratio increasingly becoming the binding capital constraint for the largest banks in the United States. The U.S. banking system includes two basic types of capital requirements: risk-based requirements that impose a capital \"charge\" based on the underlying risk of a particular activity, and leverage-based requirements that do not differentiate based on the risk characteristics of underlying assets. And while leverage-based capital requirements are generally intended to operate as a backstop to risk-based requirements, changes in the financial system and the broader economy can alter this relationship between capital requirements. This shift in the nature of leverage-based capital requirements, from backstop to binding constraint, was not driven by a deliberate policymaking process, but rather by the maintenance of a high level of reserves in the banking system, as well as the introduction of liquidity requirements that compelled banks to replace loans with high-quality liquid assets.2 Monetary Policy and Economic OutlookBefore turning to the main theme of my remarks, I would like to give a brief update on my outlook for the economy and monetary policy. At the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last week, the Committee voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4â1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. I supported this decision because the data shows a solid labor market and I would like to see further confirmation that inflation is close to our 2 percent target on a sustained basis. If inflation remains near its current level or continues to move closer to our target, or if the data show signs of weakening in labor market conditions, it would be appropriate to consider lowering the policy rate, moving it closer to a neutral setting. At this point, we have not seen significant economic impacts from trade developments or other factors, and the U.S. economy has continued to be resilient despite some slowing in economic growth. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth slowed to a moderate pace in the first quarter, even as activity was partly boosted by a pull-forward of spending on motor vehicles and high-tech equipment ahead of the implementation of tariffs. Although the pull-forward of spending appears to be unwinding, retail and motor vehicle sales through May provide further evidence that PDFP has softened so far this year. The labor market appears to remain solid, with payroll employment rising about 140,000 per month, on average, in April and May, only slightly below the average monthly gains over the past two quarters. This pace of job gains appears consistent with the unemployment rate remaining at a low 4.2 percent through May, which is roughly unchanged since the middle of last year. The labor market appears to be stable near estimates of full employment, with layoffs remaining low. The number of job openings relative to job seekers has moved roughly sideways since the middle of last year at, or a touch below, the pre-pandemic level. And the labor market no longer appears to be especially tight or a significant source of inflation pressures, as most wage growth measures have slowed closer to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation. Turning to inflation, we have seen a welcome return to further moderation of personal consumption e penditures (PCE) inflation over the past three months. The May consumer and producer price reports suggest that 12-month core PCE inflation stood at 2.6 percent in May, down meaningfully from its elevated reading of 2.9 percent at the end of last year. Similar to the past two years, elevated monthly inflation readings in January and February have been followed by low readings as we move into the spring. On a 12-month basis, core PCE goods inflation has picked up somewhat since last December, but this has been more than offset by a considerable slowing in core PCE services inflation. It appears that any upward pressure from higher tariffs on goods prices is being offset by other factors and that the underlying trend in core PCE inflation is moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently apparent in the data. With housing services inflation on a sustained downward trajectory, and other core services inflation already consistent with 2 percent inflation, only core goods inflation remains somewhat elevated likely reflecting limited passthrough from tariffs. With economic growth slowing, it is possible that recent softness in aggregate demand could be starting to translate into weaker labor market conditions. While still strong, the labor market appears to be less dynamic, with modest hiring rates, layoffs edging up from low levels, and job gains concentrated in just a few industries. With inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2 percent, softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should put more weight on downside risks to our employment mandate going forward. Despite progress on lowering inflation, there are potential upside risks if negotiations result in higher tariffs or if firms raise goods prices independent of any tariff pass-through. Although we have not seen evidence of disruptive impacts on supply chains, changes in global trade patterns could lead to an increase in prices for goods and services. The current conflict in the Middle East or other geopolitical tensions could also lead to higher commodity prices. I am certainly attentive to these inflation risks, but I am not yet seeing a major concern, as some retailers seem unwilling to raise prices for essentials due to high price sensitivity among low-income consumers and as supply chains appear to be largely unaffected so far. Measures of policy and economic uncertainty have receded from recent highs, and measures of consumer and business sentiment have also improved in recent weeks after having dropped considerably. These developments reinforce my view that concerns will subside as more clarity emerges on trade policy. Businesses appear to be resuming investment and hiring decisions, as they feel increasingly confident that less favorable trade outcomes are unlikely to occur. I remain focused on how new policies evolve and whether future data releases will provide perspective about their economic impacts. On trade policy, I e pect that negotiations will ultimately result in lower tariff rates than are currently in place, consistent with the resumption of financial market optimism. Further, should we see effects on inflation this year, I e pect that increased slack in the economy will limit this to a small, one-off impact. Small and one-off price increases this year should translate only into a small drag on real activity. I also e pect that less restrictive regulations, lower business ta es, and a more friendly business environment will likely boost supply and largely offset any negative effects on economic activity and prices. In considering the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I fully supported the revised characterization of uncertainty and the balance of risks in our most recent monetary policy statement, pointing to the diminished uncertainty and removing the emphasis on risks to both sides of our mandate. In my view, it was appropriate to recognize that the balance of risks has shifted. In fact, the data have not shown clear signs of material impacts from tariffs and other policies. I think it is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed, and have a smaller effect than initially e pected, especially because many firms front-loaded their stocks of inventories. And, all considered, ongoing progress on trade and tariff negotiations has led to an economic environment that is now demonstrably less risky. The change in our monetary policy statement appropriately incorporates this shift in the balance of risks as well as the rapid improvement in many measures of uncertainty. As we think about the path forward, it is time to consider adjusting the policy rate. As inflation has declined or come in below expectations over the past few months, we should recognize that inflation appears to be on a sustained path toward 2 percent and that there will likely be only minimal impacts on overall core PCE inflation from changes to trade policy. We should also recognize that downside risks to our employment mandate could soon become more salient, given recent softness in spending and signs of fragility in the labor market. Before our next meeting in July, we will have received one additional month of employment and inflation data. If upcoming data show inflation continuing to evolve favorably, with upward pressures remaining limited to goods prices, or if we see signs that softer spending is spilling over into weaker labor market conditions, such developments should be addressed in our policy discussions and reflected in our deliberations. Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting in order to bring it closer to its neutral setting and to sustain a healthy labor market. In the meantime, I will continue to carefully monitor economic conditions as the Administration's policies, the economy, and financial markets continue to evolve. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook, guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of ma imum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. Bringing inflation in line with our price-stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy labor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run. Policy Shifts and Unintended ConsequencesIn my responsibilities over bank regulation and supervision at the Federal Reserve, I intend to apply a pragmatic approach. We will review data and evidence, identify problems that need to be resolved, and develop efficient solutions to address those identified issues.3While the regulatory authority of the Federal Reserve is primarily related to the banking system, theconsequencesof banking regulation and supervisory efforts are not limited to the banking system. Bank regulation and supervision affect how financial activities are conducted, the cost and availability of credit and financial services, and even what types of entities provide those services. While it is important to consider the consequences of regulatory actions as they evolve over time, in cases where regulation may create or e acerbate financial stability risks, we must e amine whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the regulation. Bank-affiliated broker-dealers play a critical role in U.S. capital markets, including in Treasury market intermediation activities. Today I will discuss the lessons we have learned about how bank regulatory requirements, specifically leverage ratios in the United States, can have unintended consequences. Leverage ratio impacts on bank-affiliated broker-dealers can have broader impacts, including market impacts like those observed in Treasury market intermediation activities. Once we've identified \"emerging\" unintended consequencesâissues that were not contemplated during the development of a regulatory approachâwe must consider how to revisit earlier regulatory and policy decisions. As I will discuss in greater detail shortly, regulators must act quickly to address the growing problems with increasingly binding leverage ratios. In 2021, in connection with the e piration of temporary, emergency changes to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), the Federal Reserve committed to \"soon\" inviting public comment on potential modifications.4Over four years later, a proposal has not been issued, and problems with Treasury market intermediation continue to emerge. The time has come for the federal banking agencies to revisit leverage ratios and their impacts on the Treasury markets. Looking at the Data: Treasury Market FunctioningAs a first step in this pragmatic approach, it is important to look at what the data says about Treasury market functioning. This is a necessary first step before we determine whether there are issues or problems that can be addressed through adjustments to bank regulatory requirements. A review of Treasury market data provides a history of growing issues with Treasury market functioning. In recent years, U.S. policy debates have highlighted the need to take preventative measures to ensure smooth market functioning. One issue that continues to persist is low levels of Treasury market liquidity as the Board's semiannualFinancial Stability Reportnoted.5In addition, some dealers e perienced balance sheet pressure in intermediating record volumes of Treasury market transactions in the spring, at a time when reports from market participants also indicated reduced demand from other Treasury investors.6 A survey of market participants from the Fed's most recentFinancial Stability Reportnoted that more than a quarter of respondents cited Treasury market functioning as a risk to the U.S. financial system and the broader global economy. This was an increase from the same survey conducted last fall when 17 percent of those surveyed cited Treasury market functioning as a risk.7 Recent changes to Treasury market clearing activities from the Securities and E change Commission's central clearing requirement for U.S. Treasuries were implemented to improve Treasury market functioning. Once fully implemented, these changes may improve market functioning. The Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility may also help to promote smooth functioning in the Treasury market. But it is unclear how the ongoing increases in the volume of Treasury issuance, the volume of Treasury securities outstanding, and changes to the Fed's balance sheet over time, may also affect market liquidity. Treasury markets have e perienced stress events as recently as the September 2019 repo market stress, and the so-called \"dash for cash\" in March of 2020. In early April, we also saw strains in Treasury cash markets. Although markets continued to function, there were une pected moves in Treasury yields, with an initial drop in yields followed by a sharp increase that seems to have been driven in part by the unwinding of the swap spread trade by leveraged investors in response to declining swap spreads. We do not know e actly what circumstances may lead to a future stress event or how it will manifest, and continuing to impose unwarranted limits on dealers' intermediation capacity could e acerbate a future stress event in this critical market. But we do know that these events have raised concerns about the resilience of U.S. Treasury markets. Therefore, we should continue to actively monitor indicators of market functioning. Recent trends in both market liquidity indicators and survey responses suggest that this problem has persisted and may be becoming more severe. Low liquidity can create more volatility in prices, e acerbate the effects of market shocks, and threaten market functioning. Identifying the Problem: Looking Beyond Treasury Market IntermediationLarge bank-affiliated primary dealers play a vital role in the intermediation of U.S. Treasury markets. These dealers are subject to, not insulated from, the effect of banking regulation. While many factors can affect market liquidity, including the growing volume of Treasury issuance, Treasury market saturation, and interest rate volatility, we must consider whether some of the pressure is a byproduct of bank regulation. Due to the role of large banks in the intermediation of Treasury markets, there is a direct link between banking regulation and Treasury market liquidity, particularly when it comes to the growth of \"safe\" assets in the banking system and the increase in leverage-based capital requirements becoming the binding capital constraint on some large banks. In 2018, the Federal Reserve along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) proposed significant changes to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) that applies to the largest banks.8These revisions were never finalized, but the intent behind them was to return the eSLR to its traditional role as a backstop capital requirement instead of what has become a substantial balance sheet constraint. The proposed change was designed to promote resilience in the banking system and to protect financial stability, while also ma imizing credit availability and economic growth throughout the credit cycle.9During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve addressed constraints on the ability of U.S. banks to support efficient Treasury market functioning by temporarily e cluding Fed reserves and Treasuries from the denominator of the SLR.10 The central role of bank-affiliated broker-dealers in Treasury market intermediation has led us to take a close look at bank regulatory requirements to clarify how these requirements, particularly their calibration, may impact Treasury market functioning. Although designed to address low risk activities, like Treasury market intermediation, leverage ratios have become increasingly binding as a bank capital constraint as market conditions change. While issues around the use of leverage ratios require close e amination, a solid capital foundation in the banking system is critical to support safety and soundness and financial stability. Revisiting the calibration of leverage ratios to ensure that they remain backstops instead of creating binding constraints, especially in times of stress, should not be interpreted as a critique of the role of capital in a robust regulatory and supervisory framework. But to be clear, theconsequencesof an overly restrictive leverage ratio go well beyond just Treasury market intermediation, and impact a wide range of low-risk activities. Leverage capital requirements do not differentiate between the risk of different asset classes or e posures. However, in periods when bank balance sheets are e pandingâlike the significant deposit inflows during COVID-19âleverage capital requirements can unintentionally become the binding constraint on both banks and their affiliates. This increases the amount of required capital as bank balance sheets grow, regardless of the underlying risk. When constrained in this way, bank-affiliated primary dealers may pull back on the market intermediation of low-risk assets like U.S. Treasuries. A binding leverage capital requirement can create perverse incentives for banks to shift their balance sheets into higher risk assets, since doing so could generate larger returns without requiring additional capital. This is simply a cause and effect of overly restrictive leverage capital. The fact of leverage ratios becoming increasingly binding is evident in simple metrics like the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total leverage e posure. These are, respectively, the denominators of risk-based capital ratios and the SLR. Shortly after the SLR was adopted in the U.S. in the mid-2010s, this ratio stood at 48 percent in the aggregate for the eight largest U.S. banks, the global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Since then, the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total leverage e posure has declined and currently stands at 40 percent, primarily due to higher reserves and other types of high-quality liquid assets on bank balance sheets. This downward trend results in the SLR increasingly becoming the binding constraint and reflects banks' growing holdings of high-quality liquid assets, most of which carry a risk weight of zero underrisk-basedcapital ratios but have a 100 percent weighting underleveragecapital ratios. Efficient SolutionsOne e ample of the SLR's unintended consequence is the erosion of liquidity in U.S. Treasury markets because it is driven, in part, by leverage ratio requirements increasingly becoming the binding constraints on the largest U.S. banks. This e ample also illustrates the necessity of evaluating tradeoffs in regulation and speaks to a larger issue with the calibration of leverage. The banking regulators are uniquely positioned to both analyze and remediate components of the bank regulatory framework that may disrupt banks' participation in low-risk, but economically critical activities. This includes the e acerbation of Treasury market illiquidity. Treasury markets play a critical role in the U.S. and global financial systems, and we should be proactive in addressing the unintended consequences of bank regulation, while ensuring the framework continues to promote safety, soundness, and financial stability.11We should start by addressing potential constraints on Treasury market functioning before issues arise, lessening impacts from stress, and mitigating the need to intervene in future market events. On Wednesday, the Board is scheduled to consider specific amendments to the eSLR, which is the requirement that applies at both the holding company and bank levels of the largest U.S. banks. While I do not want to front-run the proposal, I will note that the proposal's goal is to address a long-identifiedâand growingâproblem with the calibration of this leverage requirement. The proposal would solicit public comment on the impacts of this miscalibration, potential fi es, and work to develop an appropriate and effective solution. This proposal takes a first step toward what I view as long overdue follow-up to review and reform what have become distorted capital requirements. This proposal, while meaningful, addresses only one element of the capital framework. More work on capital requirements remains, especially to consider how they have evolved and whether changes in market conditions have revealed issues that should be addressed. In a few weeks, on July 22, the Federal Reserve will host a conference to bring together a wide range of thought leaders to discuss the U.S. bank capital framework, including the design and calibration of leverage ratios. Fi ing the design and calibration of leverage capital requirements will not resolve every issue with U.S. Treasury market functioning. But, simple reforms to return leverage ratio requirements to their traditional role as a capital backstop could improve Treasury market functioning by building resilience in advance of future stress events. And this could reduce the chances that we would need to intervene in Treasury markets should a future stress event arise. While we know well the issues created by the eSLR, there are many potential improvements that could address other issues within the capital framework. As I have noted previously, a broader set of reforms could include amending not only the leverage capital ratio, but also G-SIB surcharge requirements. We should also reconsider capital requirements for a wider range of banks, including the SLR's application to banks with more than $250 billion in assets, Tier 1 leverage requirements, and the calibration of the community bank leverage ratio. The unintended shift over time in the eSLR increasingly becoming a binding capital constraint demonstrates that we need to think about regulatory policies in a dynamic way based on the evolution in the banking and financial systems, and the broader economy. Other e amples of regulations that must take into account the impact of economic growth and inflation include elements of the G-SIB surcharge, as well as regulatory thresholds that define the broader categories of banks. Thresholds like the $10 billion definition of a \"community bank\" and the $700 billion in total assets and $75 billion for cross-jurisdictional activity separating Category II and III banks determine which regulatory requirements apply to each group. One way to prevent the original calibration from becoming divorced from the foundational policy decisions over time is to inde the relevant G-SIB surcharge coefficients and regulatory thresholds to nominal gross domestic product. While approaches like inde ing thresholds and requirements can make our regulations more robust and durable over time, we should also acknowledge the essential role of supervision as a tool to promote safety and soundness, and financial stability. Just as our capital requirements are intended to operate in a complementary manner, so do regulation and supervision act in a complementary way. These are only a handful of relevant e amples, but they are representative of an effective approach to regulatory reform. Regulations should not be created in a static world of \"set it and forget it.\" The economy evolves over time, as do the banking and financial systems and the needs of businesses and consumers. Increasingly, regulators are e pected to conduct a more thorough and detailed analysis as part of the ordinary rulemaking process, which includes a proposal's costs and benefits. Yet, over time, we tend to devote fewer resources to the work of conducting maintenance of our regulations. Maintenance of the regulatory system should include reviewing the basis for earlier policy decisions, considering whether the policies embedded in regulations have been distorted over time through market developments, and e amining whether emerging issues in the market should lead to further review and revision. Closing ThoughtsThank you for the opportunity to join you today and to provide my views on the U.S. economic outlook and current regulatory proposals. In the United States, regulatory policy objectives are prescribed by law, and bank regulators focus primarily on promoting the safe and sound operation of U.S. banks, and financial stability. Despite this limited purpose, we must understand the consequences of regulations, which can e tend well beyond the banking system. Recent trendsâincluding providing more fact-based and analytical support for proposalsâare a positive step in achieving responsible regulation. But we need a broad commitment to follow the approach I have just described. We must consider relevant data and information, identify the source of any problems or opportunity for greater efficiency, and then develop targeted and effective policy solutions and approaches. 1.

At âAssessing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy during and after the COVID-19 Pandemicâ 2025 IJCB Research Conference, hosted by the Czech National Bank and the International Journal of Central Banking, Prague, Czech Republic Thank you, AleÅ¡, and thank you to the Czech National Bank (CNB) for hosting this year's conference. The CNB also supported this conference in 2017. It is wonderful to have such a great relationship between theInternational Journal of Central Banking(IJCB) and one of our sponsoring institutions. I would like to take a few minutes as the outgoing managing editor of the IJCB to emphasize the importance of this journal and the research it supports.1Central banks play an important role promoting the growth and effective functioning of their economies, and many of the decisions they make are influenced by careful and cutting-edge research. In fact, I recently gave a speech that discussed the importance of economic research in monetary policy decisions.2The IJCB, through this conference and its volumes, provides an outlet to share and disseminate research that adds to public knowledge and understanding and informs the operational and policy decisions of central bankers. The value of central bankâfocused research has long been known. In the summer of 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank, and the Group of Ten central banks agreed to support the development of the IJCB to focus on the theory and practice of central banking. The journal has attracted distinguished managing editors, including my colleagues from the Federal Reserve; my immediate predecessor, Luc Laeven, from the European Central Bank; and the current managing editor, Antoine Martin, from the Swiss National Bank, who, unfortunately, could not be here today. We have the strong support now of nearly 55 sponsoring institutions, including the Czech National Bank and also the host of last year's conference, the Central Bank of Italy. Among the ways that central banks serve the public interest is as an ongoing source of economic research, and the strong commitment to the IJCB here in Prague and other capitals advances our collective interest in strong economies and financial stability. Turning to this year's conference, we chose the theme based on events that have been very much on the minds of central bankers: \"Assessing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic.\" The past several years have seen significant monetary policy actions across the globe in response to COVIDâ19âinduced recessions, inflation higher than in several decades, unprecedented supply chain disruptions, and, in some countries, very tight labor markets. Early on, policymakers' responses appeared quite in sync, but with differing speeds of recovery and varying challenges faced by different types of economies, that changed over time. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and energy price shocks have introduced new comple ities. So we thought this conference could be a good place to come together and hear about the lessons we have learned from these common and different e periences. Today and tomorrow we will be discussing the yield curve, policy rules, and monetary policy transmission. We also will look into banking issues such as loan issuance and financial stability. And we are lucky to have the Fed's Vice Chair for Supervision Miki Bowman here to give a keynote speech. As we go through these sessions, I hope we will all ask ourselves how this work can help policymakers do their jobs better. Through our conversation, I would ask you to share knowledge about each of these topics as they are pertinent around the world. But before we get to those presentations, and what I hope will be vigorous discussion, let me recognize several people who made this event possible. Here at the CNB, Simona Malovaná and Martin Hodula helped organize this conference. Year round, the IJCB co-editors devote many hours of their time to review papers to keep the journal at its high-quality and high-impact status. These individuals are Ana Babus, Diana Bonfim, Huberto Ennis, Carlos Garriga (who is here with us today), Refet Gürkaynak, Òscar Jordà, Robin Lumsdaine, Fernanda Nechio, Steven Ongena, and Enrico Sete. Finally, for the past three years, the day-to-day smooth running of the journal couldn't have been accomplished without the editorial team at the BIS and the Board of Governors. A special thank you goes to my team: Kommaly Dias, Jane Ihrig, and Elie Singer, who worked to oversee the process. And with that, I will step away from the microphone and put the spotlight where it should be, on the scholars presenting their work today. Thank you, and I believe Martin has a few words to get us started. 1.

The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, provides the nation with a safe, fle ible, and stable monetary and financial system. Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle W. Bowman At the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, Washington, D.C. It is a pleasure to join you today for my first public remarks as the Federal Reserve Board's Vice Chair for Supervision.1Today, I will describe my approach to leading the Fed's Division of Supervision and Regulation in its vital work to promote the safe and sound operation of the U.S. banking system. I have spoken e tensively in the past about my principles for supervision and regulation, which will continue to guide my approach to supervision and the bank regulatory framework.2 At the core of these principles is pragmatism, which focuses on first identifying the problem to be solved and then developing efficient solutions.3Once we have identified a need for reform, or a problem to be solved, our next task is to conduct a careful analysis of the intended and unintended consequences of any proposed policy solution, and to consider alternative approaches that lead to lower cost or better outcomes. The views I share with you today reflect my initial thoughts about how these principles should be incorporated into the important work that will be required to improve supervision and regulation in the future, addressing: (i) enhancing supervision to more effectively and efficiently meet the Fed's safety and soundness goals; (ii) reviewing and reforming the capital framework to ensure that it is appropriately designed and calibrated; (iii) reviewing regulations and information collections to ensure that this framework remains viable; and (iv) considering approaches to ensure the applications process is transparent, predictable, and fair. Enhancing SupervisionSupervision focused on material financial risks that threaten a bank's safety and soundness is inherently more effective and efficient. We should be cautious about the temptation to overemphasize or become distracted by relatively less important procedural and documentation shortcomings. Fundamentally, as I've noted in the past, our goal should be to prioritize the identification of material financial risks and encourage prompt action to mitigate risks that threaten safety and soundness. There are a number of changes we can adopt in the near term to better enable us to accomplish this goal: Tailoring.Risks are not uniform, and each bank is unique based on its business model, comple ity, and business profile. I am a long-time proponent of tailoring banking regulations. Going forward we will e tend the application of tailoring to our supervisory approach to financial institutions, not only among bank categories, but also within a particular category. In the past, the Board has \"pushed down\" requirements developed for the largest firms to smaller banks, often including regional and community banks. One approach that would preserve tailoring is to create an independent community bank supervisory and regulatory framework to clearly separate these banks from larger bank supervision and regulation. This would serve to insulate these smaller banks from standards designed for larger and more comple firms. While I have no objection to a deliberate, intentional policy to apply similar standards to firms with similar characteristics as conditions warrant, the gradual erosion of distinct regulatory and supervisory standards among firms with very different characteristicsâessentially the subtle reversal of tailoring over timeâis not a reasonable approach for implementing supervision and regulation. Both regulators and legislators should consider whether the bank regulatory framework includes appropriate thresholds for defining distinct categories of institutions, and whether simple fi esâfor e ample the inde ing of thresholds to inflation or growthâcould better ensure a sound, tailored approach that remains durable over time. It is clear that the current $10 billion threshold defining the upper bounds of a \"community bank\" leaves many institutions that pursue this business modelâof community and relationship-based bankingâsubject to heightened requirements more suitable for larger and more comple firms. To further these objectives, later this year I will host a conference on small and community bank issues, to discuss improving the bank regulatory framework to adopt a more efficient, tailored approach for these firms. We must demonstrate wisdom and courage by carefully listening to those who are subject to regulatory oversight and considering ways to enhance our approaches to both supervision and regulation. One issue that continues to present challenges to smaller banks is check fraud. The ongoing increase in bank losses to this type of fraud can negatively impact the perceived safety of the banking system and result in significant consumer harm. Past efforts by regulators have been frustratingly slow to advance and seem to have done little to address the underlying root causes of this increase in fraud. I will continue to work to identify specific actions that can be taken to reduce the incidence of fraud, including through e pediting the remediation process from check fraud after it occurs. I e pect that the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the OCC and FDIC, will soon take action on this front. Ratings. Ratings must reflect risk, and yet we have seen gradual changes in supervisory approaches that have eroded the link between ratings and financial condition.4Federal Reserve supervisory statistics show that that two-thirds of the largest financial institutions in the U.S. were rated unsatisfactory in the first half of 2024.5At the same time, the majority of these same institutions met all supervisory expectations for capital and liquidity. This odd mismatch between financial condition and supervisory ratings requires careful review and appropriate revisions to our current approach. Under the current large bank ratings framework, a single component rating can result in a firm being considered not \"well-managed,\" which has driven the disparity between well-managed status and financial condition. The Federal Reserve will soon begin to address this mismatch, by proposing changes to the Large Financial Institution ratings framework. The proposed changes will be designed to result in a more sensible approach to determining whether a firm is well-managed, no longer disproportionately weighting a single framework component for a firm that has demonstrated resilience under a range of conditions and stresses. This initial change should help address the gap between assessed ratings and material financial risk for those firms subject to this framework. We have an obligation to ensure that our supervisory ratings are current, credible, and reflect material financial risk. This promotes effective supervision and ensures that firms are accurately rated based on their underlying financial strength, which should increase the public's confidence in our assessment of the banking system. We must also consider the appropriateness of the broader ratings framework which applies to smaller institutions, including the CAMELS framework. Are these frameworks appropriately tailored to capture material financial risks, particularly for elements that rely on subjective e aminer judgment? While judgment is a legitimate and necessary tool in supervision, it must always be grounded in the materiality of the identified issues as they relate to the financial health of each institution and the banking system as a whole. This has been a notable shift in supervision not only for large banks, but also for regional and community banks. Improving prioritization.E aminers review a broad range of activities in the supervisory process. A random sample of e amination reports demonstrates that supervisory focus has shifted away from core financial risks (credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk, for e ample), to process-related concerns. While process is important for effective management, there is a risk that overemphasis on process and supervisory bo -checking can be a distraction from the core purpose of supervision, which is to probe financial condition and financial risk. Checklists should not distract e aminers from the central purpose of e aminations. Another tool that we will be reviewing with a critical lens is the use of horizontal reviews. In theory, horizontal reviewsâwhere e aminers conduct a narrow but deep review on a particular topic across multiple banksâcan help improve an e aminer's perspective. Horizontal reviews, when used effectively, can help supervisors better understand the range of industry practices. But these reviews have quickly evolved into oversimplification of comple issues and often include \"grading on a curve,\" where firms are rank-ordered, with an e pectation that implementing a simpler approach fails to meet expectations, under the assumption that the more comple approach is appropriate for all firms. However, this side-by-side comparison fails to address the only question that matters: whether a firm's approach meets appropriate legal and supervisory standards for the individual firm's characteristics. Differences in approaches are not indicative of shortcomings, particularly since these can often be e plained by distinguishing the underlying activities, scope and scale of operations, and risk tolerance of the firm's board and management. There is also a lack of transparency in the results of these e ams, and a risk that horizontal reviews will create generally applicable rules without complying with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). I will be looking closely at whether the continued use of horizontal e ams going forward is appropriate, and if so, to ensure that these e ams are sufficiently transparent, they reflect proper respect for the APA, and do not circumvent our responsibility to provide each regulated institution with a fair, firm-specific evaluation. The role of guidance in supervision.Finally, I will discuss the important role of guidance in the supervisory process. Guidance can be an effective tool to promote transparency in supervisory expectations, to provide clarity to regulated institutions on the permissibility of new activities and their associated risks, and to provide firms some perspective on how they may comply with statutory and regulatory requirements. Structured with these goals in mind, guidance can further the objective of supervisory prioritization. Where guidance does not further these objectives, it is worth revisiting. I think it is important that we review a wide range of existing guidance, including outstanding Supervision and Regulation Letters (SR Letters), topical guidance that addresses issues that may adversely affect innovation (like the extensive guidance that has some bearing on third-party risk management), and the many other guidance documents that have been issued in recent years. Fundamentally, guidance should clarify expectations, and provide answers to industry questions, such as our earlier \"office hours\" guidance that provided a venue for banks and innovators to share information on new products and services like digital asset activities and artificial intelligence. Changing expectations around the use of guidance, as a tool to promote clarity in supervisory expectations, can encourage innovation in the banking system. Uncertainty in supervisory expectations has long been an obstacle to banks seeking to innovate, including banks engaging in digital asset activities or incorporating new technologies like artificial intelligence to improve efficiency and delivery of products and services. Just as it is imperative that banks innovate to remain competitive in the future, it is critical that bank supervisors enable the adoption of new technologies in a manner consistent with safety and soundness. E aminer training and workforce development.E aminers must engage in a challenging course of study and pass rigorous tests before qualifying to become a commissioned bank e aminer. Those who have obtained this license have a strong foundation that they can rely on to conduct appropriate e aminations. The commission demonstrates an elevated level of e pertise, judgment, and fairness that these e aminers bring to their work. As such, they should not shy away from transparency or public accountability. Currently, the Federal Reserve does not require all staff involved in supervision and bank e amination to have met or to be on a path to meet this credential. Regulated entities should be able to e pect that all of our e amination and supervisory teams have achieved or are working to achieve this level of professional e pertise. Going forward, the Fed will prioritize this training, particularly as we face an aging workforce across the Federal banking agencies that will require our new e amination staff to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system into the future. Failure to invest in and plan for e aminer training today will result in much less effective supervision in years to come. CapitalCapital requirements are an important component of the prudential regulatory framework and are essential for the stability of interconnected banking and financial systems around the world. Yet too often, our efforts to address capital reform take a piecemeal approach to capital requirements. We tend to review individual elements of the capital framework in isolation, without considering whether proposed changes are sensible in the aggregate and contribute to a capital framework in which all components work together effectively. While each component is important, the aggregate calibration of requirements is ultimately the most meaningful, and we must e amine whether this approach in totality appropriately captures risk. Over-calibrated capital requirements effectively create market distortions, disfavoring some activities over others in a way that is divorced from prudential safety and soundness goals and economic conditions. Leverage ratios are one e ample that illustrates this concern. The Federal Reserve has long acknowledged that leverage ratios are intended to act as a \"backstop\" to risk-based capital requirements. When leverage ratios become the binding capital constraint at an e cessive level, they can create market distortions. This is especially true in the case of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) which is applicable to the largest banks. As a result of this leverage requirement, banks are less inclined to engage in low-risk activities like Treasury market intermediation and revise their business activities in a way that is neither justified nor responsive to their customer needs. These distortions can also create broader financial system impacts like increased stress on Treasury market functioning. To be clear, the increasing bindingness of the eSLR on the largest firms did not result from careful policy debate and discussion. Instead, it is an unintended consequence of market and other bank regulatory requirements implemented after it was originally put in place. The original calibration of the eSLR was based on forecasts of the level of reserves and other so-called \"safe assets\" in the system that are now far out of line with current levels. I e pect that in the near future, the agencies will publish a proposal to help address this concern and ensure that the eSLR resumes functioning as a backstop capital requirement. While this fi to the eSLR is necessary, it may not be sufficient to address issues in the capital framework. In July, the Federal Reserve will host a conference that will broaden our perspective in the consideration of capital requirements for large banks. We will bring together bankers, academics, and other capital experts to e amine whether capital requirements as currently structured and calibrated are operating as intendedâin a complementary fashion. I welcome the opportunity to consider a broader range of perspectives as we look to the future of capital framework reforms. In addition to considering potential changes to leverage ratio requirements and stress testing, the capital conference will also include a discussion of potential reforms to the GSIB surcharge and the Basel III capital requirements. The Board has already proposed a significant change to reduce the volatility in capital requirements resulting from our current stress testing process. The proposal includes providing a longer implementation timeline to phase in the annual stress capital buffer requirement. And later this year, the Board will consider more extensive changes aimed at promoting transparency, fairness, and predictability in the stress testing program. While stress testing is an important supervisory tool, its implementation, outcomes, and processes have raised significant questions and concerns about its effectiveness in identifying systemic weakness. The lack of transparency around the models used in stress testing prevents meaningful discussions about how the stress tests can be improved. Capital has an impact on the business activities of all banks. Although the capital framework for the smallest institutions tends to be simpler and more straightforward, calibration and design elements play an important role in the functioning of smaller banks just as they do for larger banks. Therefore, it is important that we also take the opportunity to address issues for smaller banks, that provide critical support to their local communities and the economy. On this front, we will review and consider the community bank framework, including capital requirements like the calibration of the community bank leverage ratio, and whether reforms to the capital framework for mutual banks can be improved to promote capital formation. I look forward to the results of public engagement on these issues, including through the upcoming conferences. As we consider bank capital requirements, the focus should be on achieving a capital framework that provides a strong foundation for the banking system, appropriately requires banks to hold capital corresponding to risk, and works together with bank supervision to support a safe and sound banking system. Review of Regulations and Information CollectionsSince the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act nearly 15 years ago, the body of regulations that all banks are subject to has increased dramatically. Many of the reforms made after the 2008 financial crisis were important and essential to ensuring a stronger and more resilient banking system. Yet, a number of the changes were backward lookingâresponding only to that mortgage crisisânot fully considering the potential future unintended consequences or future states of the world. With well over a decade of change in the banking system now behind us post-implementation, it is time to evaluate whether all of these changes continue to be relevant. Some of the regulations put in place immediately after that financial crisis resulted in pushing foundational banking activities out of the regulated banking system into the less regulated corners of the financial system. We need to ask whether this was and continues to be appropriate. These tradeoffs are complicated, and we must consider not only the changes that were made but also the evolution of and differences in the banking system today. Driving all risk out of the banking system is at odds with the fundamental nature of the business of banking. Banks must be able to earn a profit and grow while also managing their risks. Adding requirements that impose more costs must be balanced with whether the new requirements make the correct tradeoffs between safety and soundness and enabling banks to serve their customers and run their businesses. The task of policymakers and regulators isnotto eliminate risk from the banking system, but rather to ensure that risk is appropriately and effectively managed. In a well-functioning, regulated banking system, banks serve an indispensable role in credit provision and economic stability. The goal is to create and maintain a system that supports safe and sound banking practices, and results in the implementation of proper risk management. Our goal should not be to prevent banks from failing or even eliminate the risk that they will. Our goal should be to make banks safe to fail, meaning that they can be allowed to fail without threatening to destabilize the rest of the banking system. Maintenance of the regulatory framework is necessary to ensure that our regulations continue to strike the right balance between encouraging growth and innovation, and safety and soundness. One easily identifiable way to achieve this is using the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review process, which the agencies initiated in February of last year. The EGRPRA review process requires the federal banking agencies to identify any outdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome regulations, eliminate unnecessary regulations, and take other steps to address the regulatory burdens associated with outdated or overly burdensome regulations. Prior iterations of the EGRPRA process have been underwhelming in their ability to result in meaningful change, but it is my e pectation that this review, and eventually the accompanying report to Congress, will provide a meaningful process for stakeholders and the public to engage with the banking agencies in identifying regulations that are no longer necessary or are overly burdensome. It is also my e pectation that regulators will be responsive to concerns raised by the public. Another area that is ripe for review are several of the Board's rules that address core banking issuesâfrom loans to insiders, to transactions with affiliates, to state member bank activities, and domestic and foreign activities of bank holding companies. Many of the Board's regulations have not been comprehensively reviewed or updated in more than 20 years. Given the dynamic nature of the banking system and how the economy and banking and financial services industries have evolved over that period, we should update and simplify many of the Board's regulations, including thresholds for applicability and benchmarks. Banking ApplicationsThe process to file an application and receive regulatory approval, whether it involves banks seeking ade novocharter, institutions seeking to merge, or any other application for bank regulatory approval should reflect both (1) transparency as to the information required in the application itself, and the standards of approval being applied, and (2) clear timelines for action. Recent e perience with banking applications suggests that revisions would be helpful in this space. Streamlining the applications forde novoformation, and establishing clearer standards for approval, may encourage morede novoactivity. Similar problems have affected bank mergers and acquisitions, where there have been lengthy processing delays. We need to rethink whether many of the additional requests for information can be addressed through better application forms or relying on information that is available from bank e aminations. We should also consider factors that force applications to be moved from Reserve Bank-delegated processing to requiring consideration by the Board. One e ample is the perverse effect of \"competitive\" screens that disproportionately affect transactions in rural and underserved banking markets. Another is the treatment of adverse public comments that may lack factual support or rely on matters already considered in the review process, including existing supervisory records. Closing ThoughtsI am honored to have the opportunity to serve as the Vice Chair for Supervision. The work of supervision and regulation is critical to maintaining a safe and sound banking system and protecting U.S. financial stability. Conditions constantly evolve in the banking system, and so too must the regulatory and supervisory framework. We must be proactive and responsive in the face of emerging risks and ensure that the framework operates in an efficient and effective manner. The steps I have identified today are intended to further these goals by creating an initial roadmap to refocus supervisory and regulatory efforts on the core financial risks most critical to maintaining a healthy and resilient banking system. I look forward to working with my Board colleagues and my counterparts at the other banking agencies as we pursue sensible and pragmatic reforms. 1.

At the Economic Club of New York, New York, New York Thank you, Barbara, and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It is an honor to join other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) who have addressed the Economic Club of New York over the years.1 My subject is the current state of the U.S. economy, the economic outlook, and the implications for monetary policy. The short version is that the labor market appears resilient and stable and economic activity is continuing to grow, although at a more moderate pace than in the second half of last year. While the labor market is currently at or near the FOMC's goal of ma imum employment, there is the prospect that trade and other policy changes could raise the unemployment rate and push employment away from our objective. These policies, especially higher import tariffs, could also raise inflation over the rest of this year. In fact, while progress toward the FOMC's goal of 2 percent inflation has continued, we have seen an escalation in goods inflation and data from surveys, and non-traditional sources point to some inflationary pressures as well. In addition to increases in U.S. import tariffs and retaliatory increases in the tariffs foreign countries apply to U.S. e ports, other policy changes, either proposed or already underway relate to immigration, fiscal policy and regulation. Those policies could affect economic conditions, and since it is the FOMC's job to set monetary policy that is best able to achieve our mandated goals of ma imum employment and stable prices, we must consider the effects of these policies. So far, we are beginning to see the impact only of higher tariffs on inflation. Still, thinking about the outlook requires consideration of how the economy could be affected by all these policy changes moving forward. It remains difficult to judge the current strength of economic activity, based on data through the first four months of 2025, primarily because of the front-loading of imports ahead of the implementation of tariffs. While real gross domestic product (GDP) declined slightly in the first quarter, that was largely because of a surge in imports ahead of anticipated tariff increases, a surge that will likely reverse. Putting aside fluctuations in trade and in inventories and focusing on the April data, personal income and consumption point to a slight moderation in economic activity. While personal disposable income increased at a healthy pace so far this year, consumption grew more slowly in April, which may indicate consumers are becoming more cautious. That said, there is considerable uncertainty about imports in the second quarter and uncertainty about the impact that higher prices will have on spending, so I will be looking for more evidence about economic activity in May ahead of the FOMC's next meeting, June 17 and 18. One encouraging sign about economic activity is the resilience of the labor market. We will get the May employment report tomorrow, but the data in hand indicate that employment has continued to grow and that labor supply and demand remain in relative balance. In April, employers added 177,000 jobs, slightly higher than the average for the previous si months. The unemployment rate was steady in April at 4.2 percent, in the historically low range of 4 percent to 4.2 percent that it has remained in since May 2024. Data on job openings and quits for April likewise point to a resilient but somewhat looser labor market with a balance of supply and demand. The vacancy rate, a measure of demand for workers, was 4.4 percent, down from a peak of 7.4 percent three years ago and roughly the same level as just before the pandemic.2The quits rate, an indicator of the confidence workers feel in finding a job, has been in the narrow range of 1.9 to 2.2 percent since December 2023, and just a bit below the average level in 2019.3 Ahead of tomorrow's employment report, other data that we have for May are generally consistent with this picture of the labor market but may suggest some cooling. The average of private-sector forecasters' predictions for total job creation is 130,000.4Also, while the pace of job layoffs remained at historically low levels through the final week of May, based on the number of new claims for unemployment benefits, other measures suggest modest increases in layoffs. For instance, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifications (WARN notices) of layoffs have ticked up since the beginning of the year, as have the mentions of layoffs in the Fed's Beige Book survey and job cuts data reported by Challenger, Gray and Christmas. The other side of the FOMC's dual mandate is price stability. Progress in lowering inflation toward the Committee's 2 percent target has slowed some since last summer, even if headline and core inflation have continued to decline. The FOMC's preferred inflation gauge, based on personal consumption e penditures (PCE), grew at a 2.1 percent annual rate in April. While that is quite close to the FOMC's target, it was dragged down by a decline in energy prices. Core inflationâwhich e cludes volatile prices for food and energy and is a good guide to future inflationâcame in at 2.5 percent, so I do believe that our monetary policy stance, which I view as modestly restrictive, is currently appropriate to achieve and sustain 2 percent inflation over the longer term. Sticking with core inflation, to help me judge ongoing progress toward price stability, I like to look at the 12-month change in each of the three main categories of core inflation: housing services, services e cluding housing, and goods. The PCE price inde for housing services has declined markedly in the past year, from 5.7 percent in April 2024 to 4.2 percent in April this year, but it is still considerably above the level that persisted before the pandemic. Meanwhile, the PCE price inde for core services e cluding housing, which makes up more than half of core PCE inflation, has declined from 3.6 percent in April last year to 3 percent in April 2025, still somewhat above the level that prevailed before the pandemic. And the third category is core goods inflation, which rose at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the 12 months through April, compared with April 2024 when it had actually fallen 0.5 percent over the previous 12 months. In recent decades, core goods prices have typically fallen over time, helping to keep a lid on overall inflation, so this is a meaningful reversal of the disinflationary process. To sum up, while core services inflation has fallen, it is still running above the rate before the pandemic, and the progress on core goods inflation has reversed. I have been paying attention to this reversal for some time and how this could be e acerbated by the announced and implemented tariffs. Research published recently by Federal Reserve Board staff calculates the pass-through of tariffs enacted before April 2 to individual product categories tracked in personal consumption e penditures.5Using PCE data from February through April, the authors estimate that the 20 percentage point increase in tariffs on Chinese imports earlier in the year raised overall core PCE prices by two tenths of 1 percent. Since tariffs on China are currently higher than 20 percent, and tariffs have increased for other countries, these results tell me, first, that the pass-through of tariffs into prices is relatively quick, and, second, should elevated tariffs persist, even just in the short run, larger effects may be coming soon. The import surge I mentioned earlier, ahead of sharp tariff increases, has delayed the price effects associated with those tariffs, and the reversal in that surge that I e pect in the next few months will likely signal larger price increases. An important feature of most of the data I have mentioned so far is that it is released with significant lags. For e ample, the initial estimate of GDP is released about 30 days after the end of the quarter, and two later revisions mean that we may not get a clear idea of how output increased until nearly three months afterward. Monthly data on job openings are typically released with a one-month delay. The reasons for these lags are well known. For instance, statistical agencies can only survey households and businesses every so often, and it takes time to compile and publish high-quality statistics. Still, if policymakers solely rely on these traditional data to forecast what the economy will do in the future, they end up focusing on the past, which is a little like driving down the road by looking in a rearview mirror. As I mentioned in my speech last year to the National Association for Business Economics, there has been an e plosion of nontraditional or soft data produced by the private sector, giving us an opportunity to measure economic developments with greater timeliness (sometimes even in real time), at a higher frequency, and with more granularity.6These data are released closer to the time of collection, such as several surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks. Given today's fast-changing and uncertain environment, soft and non-traditional data becomes all the more important. That said, nontraditional data often face their own challenges, including issues with representativeness, the lack of methodological consistency, and a short time-series history. And, to be clear, while some non-traditional data are indeed \"soft data\" in that they capture sentiment or expectations, other data in this category are decidedly \"hard,\" since they are based on actual decisions and actions by businesses and households. In evaluating both traditional and nontraditional data on the economy, I face a tradeoff between timeliness and precision, but both sources are essential for me in formulating an outlook. So, in the conte t of hard data that has lately been providing a less-than-clear view of the economy, what are the nontraditional data telling me about meeting the FOMC's two economic objectives? On the price-stability side, survey data from businesses suggest that price increases are coming. These surveys report diffusion inde es, which are calculated as the percentage of total respondents reporting increases in prices minus the percentage reporting declines. Surveys for May point to inde es for inputs and selling prices being elevated relative to the beginning of the year, probably reflecting effects from higher tariffs. Manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), as well as several surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks report increases in material prices and prices charged to customers, with many respondents volunteering that this is related to tariff increases. I believe expectations of future inflation are an important determinant of current inflation, and data for May continue to point to increases in measures of near-term inflation expectations. An average of private-sector economists published by the Survey of Professional Forecasters finds that expectations for core PCE inflation over the next year moved up from 2.4 percent in April to 2.9 percent in May. Among data on inflation expectations, the most dramatic increases have been seen in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. While I take seriously the concern that recent methodological changes in the survey may have made this measure less reliable, this survey is a longstanding and important barometer of consumer sentiment, and I still monitor the signals it is giving us closely. According to the Michigan survey, consumers e pect inflation in the next year to average 6.6 percent and over the next 5 to 10 years to average 4.2 percent. Tariffs continued to be an important issue in the Michigan survey, with nearly three-quarters of consumers mentioning them, up from almost 60 percent in April. Firms have also raised their inflation expectations, with a survey by the Cleveland Fed reporting an increase in one-year-ahead expectations from 3.2 percent in the first quarter to 3.9 percent in the second. However, I still see stability in most measures of longer-run inflation expectations. Notably, expectations among professional forecasters for inflation 6 to 10 years ahead decreased from 2.1 percent in April to 2 percent in May. That provides me some comfort, as it points to confidence from the public in the Fed to bring inflation to our goal of 2 percent over the medium term. Recent developments and the data I have been monitoring have led me to consider at least three channels through which tariffs could have a persistent influence on inflation. First, as I have mentioned in some previous speeches, while it is true that short-run inflation expectations are influenced by short-term economic shocks, I value them because they often represent the horizon of decisionmaking for businesses and consumers.7The increase in short-run inflation expectations that I previously mentioned may give businesses more leeway to raise prices, thus increasing the persistence of inflation. A second channel for tariffs influencing inflation could be opportunistic pricing by firms, if they take advantage to increase prices of items not directly affected by tariffs. This, along with tariffs on intermediate goods, could generate second-round effects on inflation. And a third channel is that lower productivity may lead to upward pressure on prices. As firms adjust to the higher input costs and lower demand, they may cut back on capital investment and shift to a less-efficient combination of inputs. While, so far, I have only seen anecdotal evidence for the opportunistic pricing among these three channels, I am closely monitoring any signs of increased persistence on inflation. Nontraditional data indicators of real activity suggest that the economy might be starting to slow. Measures of household sentiment about economic conditions remain downbeat, such as those from the University of Michigan or the Conference Board. As for businesses, manufacturing surveys, such as the ISM, report a slowing in new orders. Additionally, the May Beige Book reports that economic activity has declined slightly relative to April. On the services side, representing the majority of businesses, the ISM PMI has trended down in the past few months and reached a level in May consistent with stagnation. Focusing on the ISM services new order component, it declined significantly in May to one of its lowest levels in recent years. In summary, the nontraditional data on economic activity are consistent with my overall assessment that we might be seeing some moderation in the growth of economic activity but not yet a significant slowdown. As policies on fiscal matters and immigration take shape, I find it important to also account for their implications for the U.S. economic outlook. On the fiscal side, the omnibus bill passed by the House would add stimulus to the economy.8On the immigration side, we have seen inflows substantially down since last year, which decreases the labor supply and could add meaningful upward pressure to inflation by the end of the year in sectors reliant on immigrant labor such as agriculture, construction, food processing, and leisure and hospitality. That said, I have not yet seen much of an imprint on wages from these developments. Let me conclude with the implications of all this for monetary policy. As inflation has declined over the past two years, due in part to tighter monetary policy, the U.S. economy has remained resilient, with stable labor markets and employment near its ma imum sustainable level. Disinflation has slowed, and we are already seeing the effects of higher tariffs, which I e pect will continue to raise inflation over 2025. I see greater upside risks to inflation at this juncture and potential downside risks to employment and output growth down the road, and this leads me to continue to support maintaining the FOMC's policy rate at its current setting if upside risks to inflation remain. I view our current stance of monetary policy as well-positioned for any changes in the macroeconomic environment. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today, and I look forward to what I e pect will be interesting questions. 1.

      "content": "Why is River Island in trouble? 1 hour ago Share Save Charlotte Edwards Business reporter, BBC News • @edwardsclm Share Save Getty Images The future of River Island is in the balance ahead of a crucial court ruling on the fashion chain's restructuring plans. The British chain - which once collaborated with Rhianna - revealed in June that it intends to close 33 shops in the UK, putting hundreds of jobs at risk, and also wants its landlords to cut rents at a further 71 stores. It said more people shopping online and higher costs to run stores had contributed to heavy financial losses. Reports have suggested it could collapse if its plans are not accepted by the High Court next month, although the firm said it was \"confident\" they will be. So what has gone wrong for the High Street stalwart? Catherine Shuttleworth from Savvy Marketing said River Island's challenges were \"significant\" but they were shared by the wider retail industry. She believed the fashion chain had been affected by several factors including having its stores in the wrong place and facing rising costs. \"River Island has maintained an e pensive portfolio of stores at a time when costs are rising and footfall is falling,\" she told the BBC. \"Many older stores find themselves in parts of town which may have been busy 20 years ago but now find themselves on the periphery.\" Known for affordable and stylish fashion, brands such as River Island and Topshop dominated High Street fashion from the early 2000s to the mid 2010s. The first River Island store opened in 1988, after being originally founded in 1948 under the Lewis and Chelsea Girl brand before being renamed. The family-owned retailer currently has 230 shops, employs about 5,500 people and was one of the first big UK High Street names to launch online in the late 1990s. But recent years have proved tough. Ben Lewis, chief e ecutive of River Island, said last month that a sharp rise in \"the cost of doing business\" over the past few years had \"only added to the financial burden\". Intense competition in fashion retail, not only from the likes of Boohoo, but also from Chinese giants such as Shein and Temu, have also added to its challenges. Its most recent set of accounts revealed a £33.2m loss, with sales down 19%. Getty Images Rihanna collaborated with River Island in 2013 More on retail closures River Island reveals locations of 33 shop closures More than 1,000 jobs at risk as Poundland plans 68 store closures Creditors will start to vote on River Island's restructuring plan on 1 August, and the High Court will decide whether to approve it on 7 August. If the plans are rejected, then it is understood the retailer will revise its strategy. River Island says the plan is a \"proactive measure\" to place it on \"a firm footing\". \"We have been having positive conversations with key stakeholders and are confident that we will achieve approval of the plan in the next few weeks,\" a spokesperson for the retailer said. Nick Sherrard, managing director of Label Sessions, said River Island was in trouble now because of actions not taken years ago. \"What's very apparent here is that from landlords and suppliers, to investors, no one believes in River Island enough to do it some favours,\" he told the BBC. Mr Sherrard also said River Island was missing the mark when it comes to keeping loyal customers. \"Customers know it, but they don't know why they should care about the brand,\" he added. Getty Images River Island launched a range of T-shirts in aid of The Prince's Trust in 2009 Can it make a comeback? Mr Sherrard said River Island may need more time to turn its fortunes around. \"River Island's leadership team clearly think that if they can just get a few more months, they can turn the ship around, but the best businesses know that you always have a lot less time than you think before change hits the market,\" he said. Remy Farrell, fashion editor at the Who What Wear website, told the BBC that River Island's fate depends on how it chooses to rebrand. \"Times are tough for High Street brands that need to feel premium to stay afloat.\" she said. The current best performing brands are those that \"don't rely on buzzy microtrends\", she added, but provide \"interchangeable pieces rather than seasonally targeted drops\". \"As we wait with baited breath for the return of Topshop to see just how well the nostalgia factor will support an affordably-priced, younger-skewing brand in the years to come, the concern here for River Islands longevity is who its key market is.\" Additonal reporting by Connie Bowker Companies Retailing",

      "content": "Government considering having borrowing assessed once a year 8 minutes ago Share Save Faisal Islam Economics editor, BBC News • @faisalislam Share Save Getty Images The government is considering only having the public finances formally assessed once a year after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggested it should do to avoid \"overly frequent\" changes in policy as a result of its borrowing rules. The UK's independent forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - currently assesses if the government is on course to meet its limits on borrowing twice a year. This year changes in its forecast for the economy, driven by rises in global and domestic government borrowing rates, led to Chancellor Rachel Reeves announcing £5bn in health-related welfare cuts. However, the cuts were then reversed after a Labour backbench revolt last month. The influential IMF, as part of its annual health check of the UK economy, said the best solution would be for the government to allow greater room for manoeuvre around its fiscal rules, \"so that small changes in the outlook do not compromise assessments of rule compliance\". Fiscal rules are self-imposed by most governments in wealthy nations and are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets, which governments depend on to borrow money. The IMF, in general, praised the UK economy and recent \"bold agenda\" of pro-growth reforms, saying its medium-term borrowing plans were \"credible\" and that the UK's trade deals meant it was well placed to ride out current global uncertainties. But it said risks to the government's strategy must be \"carefully managed\" in a nod to the relatively small buffer that the UK has to deal with shocks to the economy. \"Fiscal rules could easily be breached if growth disappoints or interest rate shocks materialise,\" the IMF said. To head off this possibility, it suggested the government should consider replacing the state pension triple lock , widening the applicability of VAT, means-testing more benefits, and co-payments for richer users of the NHS. What is the IMF and why does it matter? Faisal Islam: We are heading for significant ta rises The fact the IMF's suggestion of cutting the number of assessments is under consideration by the government is an implicit admission that the current policy of having two a year has created a dynamic of constantly having to change policies to meet targets. The advice from the IMF, if followed, could mean more ta rises than e pected at the Budget in the autumn, as the chancellor rebuilds a bigger financial buffer to deal with a volatile global economy. In response to the IMF's report, Treasury officials said the government was \"committed to meeting its non-negotiable fiscal rules\" and added that it welcomed and would consider the watchdog's \"recommendations to further support policy stability\". The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently recommended downplaying the Spring Statement with a looser borrowing target, to prevent the need for constant fiddling of ta and spend plans. The chancellor is following two main rules for government finances. They are: day-to-day government costs to be paid for by ta income, rather than borrowing debt to be falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in Responding to the IMF's report, Reeves said: \"Today's IMF report confirms that the choices we've taken have ensured Britain's economic recovery is underway, and that our plans will tackle the deep-rooted economic challenges that we inherited in the face of global headwinds. \"Our fiscal rules allow us to confront those challenges by investing in Britain's renewal.\" International Monetary Fund (IMF) UK economy Office for Budget Responsibility",

      "content": "Hot weather boosted retail sales in June 6 hours ago Share Save Tom Espiner Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images Retail sales rebounded in June as the hot weather boosted fuel and supermarket sales, according to official data. Sales volumes were up by 0.9% in the month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said . People bought more drinks at supermarkets and summer clothes, while fuel sales were up as consumers \"ventured out and about in the sunshine\", the ONS said . The rise comes after sales fell by 2.8% in May, which was more than the ONS had previously estimated. After May's drop, a rebound in June had been e pected, but the increase was lower than many economists had forecast. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, called June's sales increase \"disappointingly small\". The monthly retail sales numbers have been up and down lately, reflecting weather patterns and a late Easter. But overall, the rise in retail spending has lost momentum, with sales up just 0.2% between April and June compared with the previous three months. That ties in with a separate survey from researchers Gfk which suggests that consumer confidence is weaker than a year ago, and supports economists' views that next month's figures on economic growth will show it was lacklustre in the second quarter of this year. How fast is the UK's economy growing and what is GDP? Sales in food stores were up 0.7% in June, the ONS said, while fuel sales rose 2.8%. \"The warm weather in June helped to brighten sales, with supermarket retailers reporting stronger trading and an increase in drink purchases,\" said ONS senior statistician Hannah Finselbach. \"It was also a good month for fuel sales as consumers ventured out and about in the sunshine.\" The Met Office said that England had its warmest June on record, and the second warmest for the UK as a whole, following two heatwaves. Heatwaves in June more likely due to climate change Sales at non-food stores rose, the ONS said, with clothing benefiting from promotions and the hot weather. This was partially offset by a fall in sales of household goods such as furniture. Jacqueline Windsor, head of retail at PwC UK, said the rebound in sales at supermarkets and fashion retailers was down to shoppers entertaining at home and refreshing their wardrobes. \"However, England's warmest June on record also discouraged shoppers from visiting high streets, with footfall declining and online retail sales penetration increasing,\" she said. The figures come after a string of negative news on the economy. Earlier this week, data revealed government borrowing was higher than e pected in June as increased spending on public services and debt interest payments outstripped revenue from ta ation. This was after data showed the economy shrank une pectedly in May and inflation rose to 3.6%. Retailing UK economy Office for National Statistics",

      "content": "Trump bickers with Powell over Fed renovation costs 4 hours ago Share Save Natalie Sherman & Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News Share Save Watch: Trump jokes he wants Powell to lower interest rates in awkward e change US President Donald Trump has spent months attacking the head of the US central bank on social media and in remarks to reporters, calling Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell names like \"numbskull\". On Thursday, the dispute played out in person, with cameras rolling, as the two men clashed over the cost of building renovations. The tense moment came as Trump has been escalating his pressure on Powell, who Trump says is moving too slowly to cut interest rates. He has repeatedly floated the possibility of firing Powell, only to quickly disavow the idea, which analysts say would rock financial markets and spark a legal battle. Trump's visit to the Federal Reserve is the first by a sitting president in roughly two decades. It comes ahead of the Fed's meeting in Washington next week, where policymakers are widely e pected to vote to leave interest rates unchanged. Speaking to reporters at the start of his tour, Trump said that the administration was \"taking a look at what's happening\" at the Fed's $2.7bn (£1.8bn) renovation. \"It looks like it's about $3.1bn,\" Trump said, as Powell shook his head. \"I'm not aware of that,\" Powell shot back. \"I haven't heard that from anybody at the Fed.\" Trump then produced a document from his jacket pocket, which Powell briefly read and brusquely handed back to the president, saying that Trump was \"adding a third building\" to the total. \"It's a building that's being built,\" Trump said. Powell responded: \"It's a building that was built five years ago... it's not new.\" Project costs for renovating the Eccles Building and the 1951 Constitution Avenue building have risen from $1.88bn in 2019 to $2.45bn in 2025, according to the Fed board's budget for this year. However, the increased funding has been met by the budgets from other building renovation projects being lowered and reallocated. Trump discussed firing Fed boss but 'highly unlikely' he will Why Trump keeps attacking the US central bank Trump was asked by a reporter what he, as a real estate developer, would do with a project manager who was over budget. \"Generally speaking, I'd fire him,\" he responded. After his visit to the Federal Reserve, Trump wrote on social media that construction has \"got a long way to go, would have been much better if it were never started, but it is what it is\". He said \"the cost overruns are substantial\" but said the US \"can afford just about anything\". \"Let's just get it finished and, even more importantly, LOWER INTEREST RATES!\", Trump said. Under US law, governors of the central bank can only be removed \"for cause\", typically understood to be major misconduct. The protection was intended to help insulate the bank from political pressure and ensure its leaders set policy in the best interests of the economy. Legal experts have said cost overruns on the construction project would not typically meet that bar. During the visit, Trump was asked whether Powell could say anything that could prompt him to back away from criticism, he said that he would \"love to lower interest rates\". Still, White House officials and Trump allies have honed in on the renovation issue. The renovation project under attack was first approved in 2017 and was intended to allow the bank to consolidate its operations. It involves two buildings from the 1930s. The Fed has blamed the cost overruns on issues such as finding more asbestos than e pected, and disputed White House characterisations of other aspects of the project, such as whether it involves a \"VIP elevator\". Trump - who has alternately referred to Powell as a \"stubborn mule\" and \"Trump hater\" - told reporters this month that he believed mismanagement of the plan was \"sort of\" a fireable offence. Getty Images The renovation project at the Fed was first approved in 2017 Trump nominated Powell for his role as Fed chair during his first presidential term, in 2017. President Joe Biden renominated Powell. His term as chairman is set to end in May 2026. Democrats have accused Trump of trying to use his attacks on Powell to \"distract and deflect\", as he faces pressure from his support base over his handling of Jeffrey Epstein files. They have also argued he is setting up Powell to be the scapegoat should the US economy weaken. Typically, the Fed lowers rates when the economy is in trouble, hoping that by making it easier to borrow it will boost economic activity and keep employment stable. It raises interest rates when it is worried about inflation, aiming to slow activity and ease pressures pushing up prices. Economists say Trump's radical changes to economic policy, including higher tariffs, ta cuts, reductions in government spending and a crackdown on immigration, have raised risks of both scenarios, making it difficult to know what the bank should do. Powell has said he believes the economy is stable enough for the Fed to wait to see what happens. Trump has said the bank should be cutting interest rates to reduce the US government's hefty borrowing costs and to make it easier for Americans to get mortgages and other loans. He maintains that inflation, which rose to 2.7% in June, has faded as a problem.

All of the traders were convicted of manipulating the interest rates used for loans between banks, know as Libor in the UK, an issue at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis. \"Following the Supreme Court's landmark decision yesterday to quash the convictions of Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, all four of our clients now intend to appeal against their convictions,\" said law firm Hickman & Rose. \"In those circumstances, they don't intend to comment further at this time,\" the firm added. The four convictions came after an investigation from the Serious Fraud Office into whether traders had been manipulating Libor for profit. Libor became the focus of allegations of wrongdoing following the financial crisis in 2008 and has now been discontinued, while its European equivalent Euribor is being reformed. Because the Supreme Court has now ruled in favour of Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo, the four traders' appeal is likely to be a more straightforward process than for Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo who argued their case for years . The Serious Fraud Office declined to comment on the appeal from the four traders on Thursday. However, it said on Wednesday in response to the ruling on Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo's case that it had \"considered this judgement and the full circumstances carefully and determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial\". The Libor scandal came to light in 2012, when it was discovered that banks were artificially inflating rates to profit from trading and were also lowering them to mask the troubles they faced following the outbreak of the global financial crisis. However, in 2023, the BBC uncovered evidence of a much larger, state-led \"rigging\" of interest rates , under pressure from central banks and governments across the world during the financial crisis. Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were normal commercial practices in order to appease public anger towards the banks over the financial crisis.

      "content": "Artificial food colours are out, so what's next? 15 hours ago Share Save Suzanne Bearne Technology Reporter Share Save Fermentalg There are hundreds of thousands of microalgae species French firm Fermentalg has been all over the planet in its search for useful microalgae. \"One of our lucky scientists got to go and climb the volcanoes in the Caribbean for e ample, and I have to restrain myself from collecting more every time I go home to New Zealand,\" says Hywel Griffiths, chief scientific officer at Fermentalg. There are hundreds of thousands of species of microalgae - microscopic organisms, which mostly live in water. They are essential to the aquatic food chain and also produce half the o ygen we breathe. Some are already used commercially, to make food, animal feed and fertiliser . But for Fermantalg one particular type, Galdieria sulphuraria, has a very useful trait. It can be used to produce a pigment, suitable for use in food, called Galdieria blue. \"We grow the algae and make a lot of it under conditions which make a lot of this particular molecule - the blue,\" says Mr Griffiths. The pigment can be used for any food and drinks and Mr Griffiths e pects the first products using Galdieiria blue will be on shop shelves early next year. Galdieria blue was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May, along with Butterfly pea flower e tract (also a blue colour) and calcium phosphate (white). The FDA also approved Gardenia blue earlier this month. Fermentalg Fermentalg grows a microalgae that produces a blue molecule New sources of colour for food are needed as artificial food dyes are on their way out. In January, the FDA announced the banning of Red Dye No. 3 in food products. In addition, the FDA is looking to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes such as Yellow Dye 5 and 6 by the end of next year as part of the government's mission to \"Make America Healthy Again\". \"For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a to ic soup of synthetic chemicals,\" FDA commissioner Marty Makary said at a press conference in April. Is food colouring bad for you? Though not an outright ban, the FDA is hoping the food industry voluntarily complies to eliminate artificial food dyes by 2026. It comes after years of pressure from parents and campaigners for the FDA to revoke approval for dyes or educate consumers more about the risks. In recent times, many US states have made their own moves to pass laws to remove artificial food colouring dyes. Countries differ on the restrictions they have in place. Historically, the UK and the European Union have been stricter than the US. The EU has been phasing out artificial colourings over the last 20 years and also introducing warnings on foods with other colours. Sensient Sensient processes natural products and e tracts the colours So, these are good times for firms developing natural alternatives. US-based Sensient creates natural colours by sourcing raw materials that are grown specifically for their colour content. For e ample, some red and purple colours are derived from carrots and potatoes. \"These crops are harvested, washed, processed into a juice, and the colour is e tracted with water or other solvents,\" says Paul Manning, chief e ecutive officer at Sensient. \"The resulting colour is further processed to stabilise the concentrate and refine it to the specific shade desired by the customer.\" But the hard work will be trying to match the synthetic colour. \"It must be equally vivid,\" says Mr Manning. \"There are plenty of e amples of brands converting to natural colours with less vivid and vibrant shades where the product does poorly in the market and customers complain about both the colour and the flavour.\" Getting a stable, bright colour also involved much work for Fermantalg. \"To our surprise we found that the process of growing the algae and the process of e tracting the colour can actually have a fairly significant impact on the stability of the product at the end, even though it's fairly heavily purified,\" says Griffiths. \"But something that we've done upstream is having an impact on how stable it is at the end.\" Will these new colours cost more? \"They are more e pensive, but in actual contribution to the end product, they're not actually that big an impact because these things are used at a fraction of a percentage in the final product,\" says Mr Griffiths. \"If you had a nosebleed and stood over the sink… you know that a little bit of colour goes a long way.\" Sensient There's a rush to produce alternative food colours Should we be letting flies eat our food waste? Why Ukraine is one of the world's most digital countries From festivals to weddings: Why drone shows are booming For the brands that have long relied on artificial colourings, it's an upheaval. \"We are reformulating our cereals served in schools to not include FD&C colours by the school year,\" says a spokesperson for WK Kellogg, the company behind Kellogg's. FD&C refers to certain certified synthetic colour additives regulated by the FDA, and approved by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Last year protesters gathered outside the company headquarters in Michigan, calling on it to remove artificial dyes from cereals such as Froot Loops. \"We will not be launching any new products with FD&C colours, beginning in January 2026,\" the spokesperson said. This year food giants including Nestle, Kraft Heinz, General Mills and Conagra have all pledged to phase out artificial food colourings . One of the challenges for food brands reliant on artificial colouring is that many natural food dyes don't necessarily have a long shelf life, says Institute of Food Technologists food scientist Renee Leber. \"Whereas synthetic dyes will outlive the shelf life of pretty much any product.\" She also says that as many brands rush to make the switch it's going to lead to a \"bottleneck\" in production. \"We don't necessarily have all these colours available. But we have 10 months to get that right.\" Given this isn't an outright ban, is it still e pected to lead to sweeping change in the US food industry? \"If you are a cereal company and you have a brightly coloured cereal and all of your competitors switch from synthetics to natural colours, then you don't necessarily want to be the last one,\" says Ms Leber. \"It's a tight timeframe but companies are doing their best to comply.\" International Business Food Technology of Business",

      "content": "US FCC clears $8bn Skydance-Paramount merger 3 hours ago Share Save Christal Hayes BBC News, Los Angeles Share Save Getty Images An $8bn (£5.9bn) merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media has been approved by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The merger between the independent film studio and one of Hollywood's oldest and most storied companies was first announced in 2024. The approval came just weeks after Paramount Global agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute with US President Donald Trump over an interview it broadcast on subsidiary CBS with former Vice-President Kamala Harris. The settlement did not include a statement of apology or regret. FCC head Brendan Carr, who was appointed by the president, announced the merger's approval on Thursday, saying he welcomed Skydance's ideas to make \"significant changes\" at CBS. The approval means the merger could be finalised soon but Paramount did not provide an e pected completion date when asked by the BBC. Skydance did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The FCC agreed to transfer broadcast licences for 28 owned-and-operated CBS television stations to the new owner. \"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" Mr Carr said. \"It is time for a change.\" Mr Carr said Skydance had made promises to the agency, including a \"commitment to unbiased journalism\" where the merged company would install a ombudsman to evaluate complaints of bias. Skydance also promised to end diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, something the Trump administration has targeted. The FCC voted 2-1 to approve the deal, with one commissioner, Anna Gomez, a Democrat, dissenting. \"After months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted. Unfortunately, it is the American public who will ultimately pay the price for its actions,\" she wrote. Paramount Global traces its origins back more than a century to the founding of Paramount Pictures Corporation in 1914. The studio has made many hit films, including the Godfather, Star Trek, and Mission: Impossible series. Paramount owns streaming service Paramount+, as well as Paramount Pictures, CBS, Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands. But the entertainment giant has struggled over the past decade. Skydance is owned by David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, who founded US technology giant Oracle. The FCC's approval was necessary for the deal to move forward. The deal, which includes CBS, Paramount Pictures and Comedy Central, was approved after a series of moves by Paramount, including settling a lawsuit from Trump. According to both the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, the settlement over the 60 Minutes interview was agreed - with the help of mediator - so as to not affect the planned merger, which the FCC was reviewing and therefore Trump technically had the power to halt. Trump had alleged the network had deceptively edited an interview that aired on its 60 Minutes news programme with his presidential election rival Kamala Harris, to \"tip the scales in favour of the Democratic party\". Paramount said it would pay to settle the suit, but with the money allocated to Trump's future presidential library, not paid to him \"directly or indirectly\". It also comes just days after CBS, owned by Paramount, announced it would end The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, who has been critical of Trump. The network said the move \"is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night [television]\" and \"is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters\".

      "content": "Trade deal on US tariffs within reach, says EU, as 1 August deadline nears 20 hours ago Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Share Save Bloomberg via Getty Images Failure to reach a deal would lead to 30% US tariffs and EU countermeasures targeting US e ports The European Union has said it believes a deal on trade tariffs with the US is \"within reach\", ahead of a 1 August deadline when President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a sweeping 30% levy on EU imports. Hopes were raised after EU diplomats suggested the US had proposed a broad 15% tariff on most European imports. A European Commission spokesman refused to speculate on the latest talks on Thursday, but said EU negotiators were working \"might and main\" to deliver a deal for Europe's consumers and companies. White House spokesman Kush Desai said earlier that any talk about deals should be seen as \"speculation\" unless it was confirmed by the president. Trump said on Wednesday that his condition for withdrawing the threatened 30% levy on EU imports was \"if they agree to open up the [European] Union to American businesses\". US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested good progress with the EU was being made. The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged at 2% on Thursday, after a series of rate cuts in recent months, and ECB President Christine Lagarde said \"the sooner this trade uncertainty is resolved... the less uncertainty we'll have to deal with\". DANIEL ROLAND/AFP ECB President Christine Lagarde said it was time to bring an end to uncertainty in transatlantic trade The chief e ecutive of French lu ury group LVMH, Bernard Arnault, said an accord similar to the one Japan reached with the US had to be reached amicably. \"We cannot afford to fall out with the United States and engage in a trade war with our companies' main market,\" he told Le Figaro newspaper in France. The EU had initially hoped for a 10% baseline in US import tariffs, along the lines of a deal the US agreed with the UK, until Trump sent a letter threatening a 30% tariff. Until now, the EU has refrained from imposing counter-tariffs on the US, even though European companies have faced an e tra 10% levy on e ports, on top of an average duty of 4.8% they faced before the Trump presidency. However, if President Trump does not approve an EU accord, then member states have agreed to hit back with a list of countermeasures on US goods worth a total of €93bn (£81bn; $109bn) that would kick in days after the US tariffs. \"These countermeasures will automatically click into force on 7 August should a negotiated outcome not happen before then,\" European Commission spokesman Olof Gill told reporters. \"Right now the EU is focused on finding a negotiated outcome with the US,\" he said, while stressing that a \"twin-tracks\" approach meant that it was prepared to react without a deal. EU delays retaliatory trade tariffs against US EU chief says ties with China at 'inflection point' Faisal Islam: Trump's tough tariff tactics are getting results The €93bn in countermeasures are made up of an initial list of €21bn - drawn up in retaliation for 25% US tariffs imposed last March on imports of European steel and aluminium - and a new list of €72bn. The first tariffs, thought to target imports such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles, poultry and jeans, have been repeatedly suspended in recent months in the hope of reaching a deal. The new €72bn in countermeasures are said to include proposed tariffs on bourbon whiskey, chemicals, cars, aircraft and aircraft parts. Another option in the EU's armoury, described as its nuclear option or trade \"bazooka\", is to impose restrictions on America's powerful service sector as well as intellectual property rights. The anti-coercion instrument (ACI), to give its formal name, was drawn up two years ago to act as a powerful deterrent when a non-EU country resorted to unfair coercion to affect European trade or investment. At the moment there is little support across the EU for this level of retaliation to be on the table, but earlier this week French Industry Minister Marc Ferracci suggested Europe should adopt a firmer approach and deploy new tools. Warning that 30% tariffs would have dramatic consequences for French industry and place some sectors in \"mortal danger\", Ferracci said various responses would need to be deployed in the event of a failure to reach a deal by 1 August.

      "content": "Shoplifting hits record high in England and Wales 22 hours ago Share Save Rachel Clun Business reporter, BBC News Share Save EPA Instances of shoplifting have continued to rise Retailers say theft is \"spiralling out of control\" after official figures show shoplifting in England and Wales is at its highest level since current records began more than two decades ago. There were 530,643 reported shoplifting offences in the year to March, a 20% increase from the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said there had been \"sharp rises\" in shop theft since the pandemic. Retail groups said they were concerned by the increase in organised crime, saying gangs were \"hitting store after store\". The figures from the Crime Survey for England and Wales for the year up to March 2025 showed shoplifting offences were at the highest level since current police recording practices began in the year to March 2003. \"The ONS figures prove what retailers have long been telling us – that retail theft is spiralling out of control,\" said British Retailers Association director Tom Ironside. He said such theft was \"not a victimless crime\", adding that it triggered violence and abuse towards staff and cost retailers and customers £2.2bn a year. \"The rise in organised crime is a significant concern, with gangs hitting store after store, even within a single day,\" he said. 'Shoplifting is not a petty crime, the costs add up' Shoplifters 'out of control' and becoming more brazen, say retailers Shop staff 'scared' as shoplifting cases rise Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) chief e ecutive James Lowman said the official statistics were only part of the story. Separate figures from the ACS crime report found convenience stores recorded more than 6.2 million incidents of shoplifting in the past year, he said. \"Retailers tell us that they won't report crime if they have no faith in it being investigated,\" he said. Mr Lowman said the figures showed that retail crime needs to be taken seriously \"throughout the justice system\". \"Only then will we be able to start bringing the numbers down and stop widespread reoffending by criminals that are acting with confidence that they will not be apprehended,\" he said. Earlier this year the government unveiled the Crime and Policing Bill which the Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said would address an \"epidemic of street theft\" , including shoplifting. Under the bill the current £200 threshold for shoplifting, which means thefts under that value are treated as summary-only offences and not prioritised by police. Mr Ironside said removing that threshold would \"send a clear signal that all shoplifting is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\" Responding to the new ONS figures , Ms Cooper said the government was working to rebuild local policing. She said more than 500 town centres would be getting e tra patrols and there would be 3,000 more neighbourhood officers and police community support officers by next spring. Retailing",

UK cars and whisky will be cheaper to e port to India and Indian te tiles and jewellery cheaper to e port to the UK under the multi-billion pound e port boost. The deal took three years to reach and also commits to a new India-UK plan to tackle illegal migration. Modi was hosted by the King at his private estate in Norfolk after meeting Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers, where the agreement was formally signed. Opponents had warned the deal could undercut British workers due to e tended social security terms, but Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said this was \"completely wrong\". He added that Indian workers on temporary secondment to the UK would get the same deal already offered to many other countries. During his visit to Sandringham, Modi gifted Charles a tree to be planted in autumn. Last year, the Indian prime minister had launched an environmental initiative which encourages people to plant a tree in tribute to their mothers. 'Landmark moment': Modi and Starmer sign India UK trade deal Sir Keir said the agreement was \"the biggest and most economically significant\" trade deal Britain had made since Bre it. \"This deal is now signed, sealed, delivered,\" he said. \"The UK has been negotiating a deal like this for many years, but it is this government that got it done, and with it, we're sending a very powerful message that Britain is open for business, and that is already generating huge confidence.\" The deal will create more than 2,200 British jobs across the country, he said, as Indian firms e pand their operations in the UK and British companies secure new business opportunities in India. Sir Keir also said a trade deal was \"not the e tent or the limit of our collaboration with India\" a country with which the UK has \"unique bonds of history, of family and of culture, and we want to strengthen our relationship further\". Modi hailed what he called \"a blueprint for our shared prosperity\". \"On the one hand, Indian te tiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, seafood, engineering goods will get better market access in the UK... \"On the other hand, people and industries in India will be able to access products made in the UK, such as medical devices and aerospace parts, at affordable and attractive prices.\" Four things you need to know about UK-India trade deal India trade deal could undercut UK workers, opposition parties say UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks The UK government said the deal - announced in May after years of negotiations - will boost the British economy by £4.8bn a year. The agreement was approved by the Indian cabinet earlier this week but has not yet been agreed by the UK parliament and is e pected to take at least a year to come into effect. The agreement includes lower tariffs on: clothing and shoes cars food, including frozen prawns jewellery and gems The government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms e panding e ports to India. UK e ports that will see levies fall include: gin and whisky aerospace, electricals and medical devices cosmetics lamb, salmon, chocolates and biscuits lu ury cars The UK already imports £11bn in goods from India but the lower tariffs agreed will make Indian e ports cheaper, including for components used in advanced manufacturing. Indian manufacturers are also e pected to gain access to the UK market for electric and hybrid vehicles. Average tariffs for UK e ports to India will drop from 15% to 3%, making it easier for British companies to sell goods in India. Whisky tariffs for e ports to India have been slashed in half, from 150% to 75%, giving the UK an immediate advantage over international competitors in reaching the Indian market, and the tariff will drop to 40% by 2035. The two prime ministers also agreed on closer collaboration around defence, education, climate, technology and innovation. Enhanced intelligence sharing and operational collaboration will also assist in tackling corruption, serious fraud, organised crime, and irregular migration. This includes finalising a new sharing agreement for criminal records, which will assist court proceedings, help maintain accurate watchlists, and enable the enforcement of travel bans. The deal has not given the UK as much access as it would have liked to India's financial and legal services industries, and talks continue on a bilateral investment treaty aimed at protecting British investments in India and vice versa. The two nations also continue to discuss UK plans for a ta on high-carbon industries, which India believes could hit its imports unfairly. The Indian government welcomed an e tended e emption on national insurance contributions, calling this \"an unprecedented achievement\" when the deal was agreed in May. The agreement means staff from Indian companies who are temporarily transferred to the UK, and staff from UK firms who are temporarily working in India, will only pay social security contributions in their home country, rather than in both places. However, the UK government stressed it already has similar reciprocal \"double contribution convention\" agreements with 17 other countries including the EU, the US and South Korea. Responding to suggestions the deal meant British workers could be undercut by cheaper Indian workers, Reynolds told BBC Breakfast: \"I can categorically tell you that is not the case. \"There is no ta advantage for hiring an Indian worker over a British worker.\" Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith claimed the trade deal had only been made possible \"because of Bre it delivered by the Conservatives\" and was \"a step in the right direction\". But he added: \"The irony should not be lost on anyone that any gains from this trade deal will be blown out of the water by [Deputy Prime Minister] Angela Rayner's union charter, stifling business with red tape, the jobs ta and, come autumn, Rachel Reeves' inevitable ta hikes that will punish Britain's makers just to reward those who do not contribute.\" However, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said Bre it was what had hindered UK jobs and growth and called for a new UK-EU customs union. \"We support the opening of trade, which is vital in the face of the tariff wars launched by Donald Trump,\" he said. \"But the gains from this deal are a small fraction of what the government could deliver for jobs and growth from a better deal with the EU.\" UK trade tariffs Narendra Modi India",

Customers reported they were unable to make or receive calls as the mobile phone and landline networks faced an outage. Some customers reported issues with making 999 calls, but the government said these had \"now been restored\". A spokesperson from BT, which owns EE, apologised for the outage and said it has \"resolved the problem and the service is running as normal\". The spokesperson said late on Thursday the issue happened \"following a technical fault impacting voice services on our network earlier today\". Outages tracker Downdetector, which relies on self-reported user data, showed over 2,500 EE customers e periencing outages at 14:00 BST, with many also reporting issues with other networks. Vodafone and Three confirmed to the BBC that they did not have network issues. Other networks had seen spikes in reports of outages on Downdetector - but these were likely to be customers from networks unable to connect to EE or BT phone numbers. Social media users had been posting about a loss of services of both EE and BT mobile and landline services. 999 calls BT said customers should use 999 as normal.

      "content": "Four things you need to know about UK-India trade deal 1 day ago Share Save Michael Race & Jennifer Meierhans Business reporters, BBC News Share Save Getty Images The government has cut ta es on Indian jewellery imported to the UK The UK and India have signed a trade deal to make it cheaper and easier to buy and sell goods and services to one another. The hope is that the agreement will benefit the economies of both countries. Sir Keir Starmer and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi together signed the agreement which the UK Prime Minister said was \"a landmark moment for both of our countries\". Here's a quick guide to what's been agreed and what it could mean for you. What has been agreed? The UK has lowered ta es on goods imported from India including: clothing and footwear food products including frozen prawns jewellery and gems some cars India has cut ta es on goods imported from the UK including: cosmetics scotch whisky and gin soft drinks higher-value cars food including lamb, salmon, chocolate and biscuits medical devices aerospace electrical machinery The deal will also allow British firms to compete for more services contracts in India. Starmer and Modi sign £6bn India-UK trade deal What will be the impact on people in the UK and India? The trade deal won't come into force for up to a year, so don't e pect to notice any immediate changes. Over time though, the UK government says lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns \"could\" lead to cheaper prices and more choice. This deal could also be a big win for UK businesses which manufacture the goods which have seen tariffs slashed, such as car makers and whisky distillers. For e ample, tariffs on whisky and gin being imported to India from the UK will be halved from 150% to 75% before reducing to 40% by the 10th year of the deal. Getty Images India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%. That will provide a boost to those two industries as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before. If businesses end up e porting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more ta . In India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins. How important is this for the UK and India? This deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years. However, it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another. The UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For conte t, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU. The EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025. Last year trade between the UK and India totalled £42bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional £25.5bn a year by 2040. In what it calls the Impact Assessment of the free trade agreement with India , the government said that over time it will boost the UK economy by £4.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth £2.8 trillion last year. However, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. It is also home to 1.45 billion people - about 20 times the population of the UK - which is a lot of potential customers. The UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow e ports by $1tn (£750bn) by 2030. What does this mean for visas? One of the reasons the UK India free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that India had made big demands about visas for Indian professionals and students to work and study abroad. The British government said it does not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK. But it does includes a three-year e emption on the social security paid by Indian employees working in the UK, on short-term visas. They will only pay social security contributions in their home country. This agreement, known as the Double Contribution Convention (DCC), is designed to ensure social security contributions are not made in more than one country. The UK has similar reciprocal DCC agreements with 17 other countries including the EU, the US and South Korea. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it did not mean Indian workers would be cheaper to hire than British staff. \"There is no ta advantage for hiring an Indian worker over a British worker,\" he told the BBC. E tra costs for visas and the NHS surcharge would mean \"you'd actually pay more for an Indian worker\", he said, adding \"no-one is being undercut\". UK trade tariffs Global trade",

      "content": "Government raises ma imum price for wind energy 22 hours ago Share Save Helen Catt Political correspondent Share Save Reuters The government has increased the ma imum price it is prepared to guarantee companies generating electricity from new wind farms. It comes as ministers are trying to meet challenging pledges to bring down household bills and create an electricity grid that it is almost entirely free of fossil fuels by 2030. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero published the details ahead of the latest auction for government-backed contracts. The auction opens in August and will be one of the last which can deliver projects in time to meet the government's target of Clean Power by 2030. The Conservatives have described the new prices for offshore wind as \"eye-watering\". The government said the prices did not represent the final guaranteed amount, as companies will put in lower bids to win contracts. A spokesperson for Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said \"the auction will reveal the true price, just like it did last year, where the auction cleared at prices significantly lower\". Each year, companies who want to build renewable energy projects bid for government-backed contracts. The government agrees to pay them a fi ed price for the electricity they produce for a set period, now up to 20 years, and up to a ma imum price known as the Administrative Strike Price, or ASP. Firms put in bids below the ASP to win project contracts and then the government sets a new guaranteed price, known as the clearing price, based on those. If electricity market prices are above the price set, the companies pay the e cess back to energy suppliers, with an e pectation it should lower bills for consumers. If prices fall below the guaranteed price the energy suppliers - and customers - pay the companies the difference. This year, the ma imum guaranteed price for offshore wind will be £113 per megawatt-hour, up from £102 in 2024. Floating offshore wind, which is a newer technology, is more e pensive at £271/MWh, up from £245. Onshore wind has seen a smaller rise from £89/MWh to £92 while the price for solar energy has come down to £75/MWh from £85/MWh. Conservative Shadow Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho said: \"These are eye-watering prices - the highest in a decade and way above the average cost of electricity last year. And this is before the hidden costs of grid, storage and wasted wind which all end up on our energy bills\" She claimed Ed Miliband was putting \"Net zero zealotry above the economy or the cost of living\". The government argues that switching to renewables will protect consumers from volatile gas prices and bring bills down \"for good.\" Britain's energy bills problem - and why firms are paid huge sums to stop producing power If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down? Johnny Gowdy, from not-for-profit group Regen, which advises on transitioning to net zero, said the ASP was about \"setting the starting point for the auction; with competitive bids we would e pect the actual auction strike price to be much lower\" \"There is also a trade-off between volume and price. If the bid prices are high then the government will procure less capacity. If the price is low then the government will be able to buy more capacity.\" He says that the cost of producing offshore wind \"probably has risen over the past couple of years\" but he adds \"we will have to wait and see the auction outcome\" to find out how much. Previous auctions have resulted in a clearing price that was lower than the ma imum offered. There is a risk to setting the ma imum price too low. In 2023, under the Conservatives, no offshore wind developers bid for any projects as they said they weren't viable at the price offered. The government has made changes to the system in the hope of attracting more bids to create competition. For the first time this year, offshore wind projects which don't have yet have full planning permission will be able to apply for a contract. The contract lengths have also been e tended for wind and solar projects from 15 years to 20 and the Energy Secretary will be able to see developer's bids before he sets the final overall budget. A spokesperson for DESNZ said its reforms to the system would \"enable a competitive auction that secures the best possible price for consumers while securing the clean energy we need to get us off the fossil fuel rollercoaster.\" Wind power Energy industry Renewable energy",

      "content": "EU chief says ties with China at 'inflection point' 23 hours ago Share Save Koh Ewe, Kelly Ng and Paul Kirby BBC News, Singapore and London Share Save Reuters The EU's challenges \"do not come from China\", i Jinping maintains EU-China relations have reached an \"inflection point\", European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told her Chinese counterpart i Jinping at a one-day summit in Beijing. \"As our co-operation has deepened, so have imbalances,\" von der Leyen said, referring to the European Union's huge trade deficit with China. She also warned China's ties with Russia were now the \"determining factor\" in its relations with the EU. i urged EU leaders to \"properly manage differences\", saying \"the current challenges facing Europe do not come from China\". Earlier in the year there were suggestions a Trump presidency could help the EU and China find common cause but instead ties have grown more fraught. The EU's 27 member states are grappling with similar pressures to China, not least the tariffs imposed on their e ports to the US. But despite this, expectations were low that anything significant would emerge from the summit, which had been halved in length to just one day, at Beijing's request. During a meeting in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa called for both sides to find \"real solutions\". \"It is vital for China and Europe to acknowledge our respective concerns,\" von der Leyen said. i called for \"mutual trust\" with EU countries at the meeting, state news agency inhua reported. \"Boosting competitiveness [does not come from] building walls or barriers, as decoupling and severing supply chains will only result in self-isolation,\" he said. Last year, the EU recorded a €305.8bn ($360bn; £265bn) trade deficit with China, a number that has doubled in the past nine years. The EU has criticised China for industrial overcapacity and imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles . Rebalancing will involve increasing market access for European companies in China, reducing e port controls and limiting the impact of overcapacity, von der Leyen said. China's foreign ministry said after the meeting that Beijing was ready to work with relevant countries to \"enhance dialogue on e port controls\". Von der Leyen and Costa also said they had pressed China to use its influence to persuade Russia to end its war in Ukraine. \"How China continues to interact with Putin's war will be a determining factor for our relations going forward,\" von der Leyen told a news conference at the end of the summit. 'Mood tense - if not frosty' Shortly after arriving in Beijing, von der Leyen described the summit as an opportunity for both sides to \"advance and rebalance\" their relationship. \"I'm convinced there can be a mutually beneficial co-operation... One that can define the next 50 years of our relations,\" she wrote on . Her words echoed the image of hope that both sides projected ahead of the summit. EU officials had said that they were ready for frank conversations, while Chinese officials had framed it as a chance for greater collaboration. China's foreign ministry said earlier in the week the bilateral relationship was at a \"critical juncture of building on past achievements and opening up a new chapter\". But i's decision to reject an invitation to Brussels earlier this year, and then to show up in Moscow in May for Russia's annual World War Two victory parade, made for a poor start. Engin Eroglu, who chairs the European Parliament's China delegation, believes that an already fragile trust between China and the EU has reached a new low: \"In this atmosphere of strategic mistrust, the mood is clearly tense - if not frosty.\" One of the main things that has led to the deterioration of relations between the two giants is the issue of the Russia-Ukraine war. The EU's decision to impose sanctions last week on two Chinese banks for their role in supplying Russia has annoyed Beijing in the run-up to this summit and made for an awkward climate. China said it had lodged \"solemn representations\" to the EU's trade chief ahead of the summit. And reports that Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas this month that Beijing did not want to see Russia lose the war in Ukraine - contradicting China's official position of neutrality - have also been circulating. Wang reportedly said that the Russia-Ukraine war would keep the US distracted from its rivalry with China - something Beijing has denied. Kallas had earlier this year called China the \"key enabler of Russia's war\" in Ukraine, adding that \"if China would want to really stop the support, then it would have an impact\". Getty Images Wang Yi and Kaja Kallas met earlier this month in Brussels Trade relations have been central to the EU's concerns. After the EU imposed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles last year, Beijing came up with retaliatory duties on European liquor. And this month, Beijing restricted government purchases of EU medical devices - a response to the EU imposing similar limitations on Chinese medical equipment in June. And perhaps more importantly, China also raised e port controls on rare earths and critical minerals this year and the European Commission's von der Leyen has accused Beijing of using its \"quasi-monopoly\" on the global market in rare earths as a weapon to undermine competitors in key industries. Europe is already frustrated by seeing its industries threatened by cheap, subsidised Chinese goods. In an earlier interview with Chinese state-linked news outlet The Paper, China's ambassador to the European Union Cai Run took issue with the EU's positioning of China as a \"partner for co-operation, economic competitor, and systemic rival\". \"The EU's threefold positioning of China is like a traffic light going green, amber and red lights all at once. Not only does it fail to direct traffic, it only creates difficulties and obstruction.\" i Jinping Asia Ursula von der Leyen China Global trade European Union",

      "content": "Tesla pledges to make cheaper cars as problems mount 23 hours ago Share Save Natalie Sherman BBC News Share Save Bloomberg/Getty Tesla has said it will build cheaper cars and win approval for its self-driving software in Europe this year after seeing sales fall at the sharpest rate in at least a decade. Elon Musk's electric car firm told investors it had started \"first builds of a more affordable model in June\" while posting a slump in car deliveries and shrinking profits. The firm is struggling as it faces cuts to US government support for electric cars, competition from Chinese carmakers and a dent to Tesla's brand from Musk's controversial political activities. Meanwhile, Tesla told investors that US tariff policy had cost the firm $300m (£221m) over the three months to June and warned of further pain ahead. Tesla's chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said the end of a ta credit for buyers of electric cars in the US was also likely to hurt. The carmaker did not provide an update on its outlook for the year, warning it was \"difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade and fiscal policies\". Sales fell by 12% to $22.4bn - the biggest drop in at least a decade - after deliveries plunged 14%. Profit shrank by 16% to $1.1bn. Musk told investors that he e pected the company's sales in Europe to increase once customers there are allowed to use the firm's self-driving software. He said he e pected the first approval to come in the Netherlands but that the firm also hoped to win sign-off from the European Union, despite it having a \"kafkaesque\" bureaucracy. \"Autonomy is the story,\" Musk said. \"Autonomy is what amplifies the value [of the company] to stratospheric levels.\" But the firm's once-fat margins have shrunk sharply, with profits down in five of the last si quarters. Tesla's share price has fallen roughly 30% from a peak last year, after Musk's support for Donald Trump helped him win the White House. Since then, relations have soured between the former so-called \"first buddy\" and the US president. Tesla shares tumble as Trump-Musk feud erupts US safety regulators contact Tesla over erratic robota is Car maker Stellantis says US tariffs have cost it €300m Musk has been vocal about his opposition to Trump's ta and spending bill, calling it \"utterly insane\". He has focused his attacks on the bill's contribution to America's mounting debt, though Trump maintains Musk is upset about decisions to end government programmes supporting electric cars. Peter Bardenfelth-Hansen, a former head of development for Tesla for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told the BBC's Today programme that selling ta credits to other carmakers \"has probably been what has enabled Tesla to grow into the masterdom that it is today\". \"That was a big, big earner for Tesla because there is absolutely no capital e penditure involved, it was directly onto the bottom line of Tesla's earnings on a quarterly basis,\" he said. \"With that slowing, dissipating, that's going to be a major blow to their income.\" As shares in Tesla tumbled 9% on Thursday, Trump took to social media to say he wanted Musk's businesses to succeed. \"Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the US Government. This is not so! I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!\" he wrote. 'Shenanigans' Investors had cheered after Musk said earlier this year he was leaving the Trump administration, hoping he would focus on the company and steer clear of politics. The announcement came shortly after mounting concerns about the company had forced the head of the company's board to publicly deny it had started looking for a replacement for Musk. But the messy break-up with the White House, as Musk has flirted with starting a new political party , has kept investors on edge. Earlier this month, Tesla investor and Trump supporter James Fishback wrote to the company's board, calling on it to determine if Musk's political ambitions were \"compatible\" with his obligations as chief e ecutive. Analyst Dan Ives, known as a fan of the company, also urged the board to impose guardrails, prompting Musk to snap back on social media: \"Shut up, Dan\". Musk's \"shenanigans\" have cost Tesla some of the passionate support that had allowed it to grow without spending on advertising, said Daniel Binns, global chief e ecutive of brand consultancy Elmwood. With the firm now facing much stiffer competition, he said it was unlikely that the launch of a new model would fi the firm's problems by itself. \"It will help... but it's got to be more than just another car,\" he said. \"The market's caught up to them. Mr Bardenfelth-Hansen said: \"We have been waiting for everything that Elon has been promising for a number of years.\" He said that in 2006, Musk had drawn up a \"secret masterplan\" promising cheap electric vehicles. \"That's almost 20 years ago now,\" he said. \"We're still sitting at the tip of our chairs waiting for the cars that he's promising.\" Companies Elon Musk Tesla Electric cars Car industry",

      "content": "UK vehicle making hits lowest level since 1953 1 day ago Share Save Simon Jack Business editor Share Save Getty Images British car and van production in the first half of this year has hit its lowest level since 1953, e cluding the industry shutdown during Covid. Car output fell 7.3% in the si months to June while the closure of Vau hall's Luton van plant helped drive van production down 45%, data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) shows. Uncertainty over tariffs in the US – the UK industry's second biggest market – meant some firms slowed or stopped production in the first half of this year. SMMT said the US-UK tariff deal which has since come into effect could help confidence, while the government said its electric vehicle (EV) grants would \"boost\" the industry. The SMMT welcomed the EV grants, but it said the new system lacked clarity and had been introduced without consulting the industry. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief e ecutive, said the half year production figures were \"depressing\" but that he hoped that the first half of this year marked \"the nadir\" for the UK auto industry. A deal with the US to reduce tariffs from 27.5% to 10% was announced in May came into effect on 30 June, with SMMT recording a small rise in vehicle production in June. What is in the UK-US tariff deal? Car maker Stellantis says US tariffs have cost it €300m However, the SMMT does not e pect to return to 2021 production levels of one million vehicles by the end of the decade. Mr Hawes said that the government's target of 1.3 million vehicles per year by 2035 was \"quite some ambition from where we are\", adding that \"we clearly require at least one, if not two, new entrants to come into UK production\" to hit the target. Production of electrified vehicles rose 1.8% with battery, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid vehicles accounting for a record of more than two in five of vehicles produced. Last week the government confirmed it will reintroduce grants of up to £3,750 on some EVs priced at or below £37,000. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Breakfast he was \"very concerned\" about the industry, which he called the \"jewel in the crown\" of British manufacturing. \"I'm very concerned about automotive, the pressures on the system which come from the US trade agenda, but also an incredible increase in capacity from China. \"It's why as a government we've adopted so many measures specifically around the automotive sector.\" While the SMMT welcomed the return of incentives that were abolished in 2022, there is widespread confusion about which vehicles will qualify for the discounts. The eligibility and level of discount will be determined by the amount of carbon emitted in the production of the vehicle and its battery. They will only be offered to manufacturers that have verified science-based targets with thresholds the government has not yet defined. It is e pected that Chinese and Korean vehicles will not meet the criteria, but little else is clear. PA Media Vau hall's plant in Luton ceased vehicle production in April 2025 \"The difficulty is, we don't know. Nobody knows, but nobody, not even government, really knows yet, which models and which brands will qualify,\" said Mr Hawes. \"I think the industry is still trying to get clarity behind its application. Right now your dealer cannot tell you whether the model you are considering is eligible.\" He said clarity was needed soon as September is the second biggest month for new car registrations. A transport department spokesperson said it e pected \"dozens of models to be eligible for the electric car grant, which will provide a substantial boost for the industry and save drivers thousands of pounds\". \"We want the discounts to become available to drivers as soon as possible, and we are engaging e tensively with vehicle manufacturers and have published guidance to help them apply as easily as possible,\" they added.

      "content": "City rate-rigging convictions quashed - what happens next? 1 day ago Share Save Andy Verity Financial investigations correspondent, BBC News Share Save Bloomberg via Getty Images After a decade-long legal battle, two former City traders who were at the centre of one of the biggest scandals of the financial crisis have had their rate-rigging convictions quashed. Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were jailed following trials for manipulating the interest rates used for loans between banks, known as Libor. On Tuesday, their convictions were overturned in a ruling that raises many questions. Could Hayes and Palombo claim compensation? In the UK, defendants who have had their convictions overturned due to a miscarriage of justice can potentially claim compensation. But it is not automatic. The key factor determining eligibility is whether the overturned conviction was deemed \"unsafe\" and whether a new or newly discovered fact proves innocence \"beyond reasonable doubt\". If those conditions are met, compensation may be awarded by the Ministry of Justice, but even then, deductions for living e penses during imprisonment may apply. Mr Hayes told BBC's Newsnight on Wednesday: \"It would be great to get some compensation, but I won't get any from the British government. I've made peace with that.\" There could be another way. After a US court threw out their rate-rigging convictions three and a half years ago , defendants including former Deutsche Bank trader, Matt Connolly, and his British former colleague, Gavin Black, sued their former employer for malicious prosecution, later agreeing confidential settlements. Could other convicted traders appeal? Seven other traders, who were sentenced to jail for rigging interest rates, are e pected to appeal. Following Mr Hayes' conviction in 2015, all the brokers he was alleged to have conspired with to manipulate interest rates were acquitted in a separate trial. But in 2016, three former Barclays traders – Jay Merchant, Jonathan Mathew and Ale Pabon – were convicted of manipulating Libor. Together with Peter Johnson, who had pleaded guilty before the trial, they were given prison sentences in July 2016 ranging from two years and nine months to si years. After serving out their time, they are now taking advice from lawyers and are likely to apply to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to refer their cases back to the Court of Appeal. Because the Supreme Court has now ruled in Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo's favour, that is likely to be a straightforward process compared to the seven-year struggle of Hayes to convince the CCRC to refer his case. Watch: The human story behind quashed interest rate-rigging convictions Will there be an inquiry? Mr Hayes has said he wants to see \"a public inquiry into how what happened to us happened\". \"How was the Court of Appeal continually able to frustrate attempts to get this matter heard by the Supreme Court?\" he asked. Mr Palombo said he \"100%\" believed he was the scapegoat for the anti-bank backlash following the 2008 financial crash. He questioned why he, as a junior trader at Barclays, was singled out. Senior politicians including David Davis, John McDonnell and Lord Tyrie, who conducted a short parliamentary inquiry into Libor manipulation in 2012, have said there should be a public inquiry. They have argued, in particular, for a probe of the interest rate manipulation ordered by banks' senior managers, under pressure from central banks and governments including the Bank of England, as e posed the BBC Radio 4 series The Lowball Tapes . There are also questions about how the Serious Fraud Office took most of its evidence from e ternal lawyers hired by Barclays, UBS or Deutsche Bank to investigate themselves. One of the reasons Mr Connolly and Mr Black brought the cases is that a judge in the US ruled that US prosecutors at the Department of Justice had \"outsourced\" their investigation to the target of the investigation – Deutsche Bank. Allowing banks to investigate themselves by employing e ternal law, firms who then handed over evidence to the US Department of Justice, put employers in a \"uniquely coercive position\" towards employees, ruled judge Colleen McMahon.

American beef has effectively been banned from the country - which has some of the strictest biosecurity laws in the world - since 2003 after an outbreak of mad cow disease. The White House had cited the restrictions when e plaining tariffs imposed on Australia in April, and US authorities reacted to the news by saying the \"major trade breakthrough\" would \"Make Agriculture Great Again\". The Australian government has denied the timing of the decision was related to the trade tiff, saying a decade-long department review found the US had improved beef safety measures. Canberra technically lifted the ban on US beef in 2019, but cattle from Me ico and Canada remained on the blacklist, and the integration of their supply chains meant this essentially barred beef from the States too. However, the US has recently introduced better cattle tracing protocols, allowing authorities to track where they were raised and respond more effectively in the event of a disease outbreak. In a statement, US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the restrictions were \"absurd\" and stressed the safety of her country's beef products. \"Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines.\" Australia's Agriculture Minister Julie Collins said the department had undertaken a \"rigorous science and risk-based assessment\" and was now \"satisfied\" that the US is managing any biosecurity threats. \"This decision has been purely based on science,\" she said in a statement. \"The Albanese Labor government will never compromise on biosecurity.\" But the opposition has suggested the government may have done just that. \"It looks as though [the ban has] been traded away to appease Donald Trump, and that's what we don't want,\" Nationals leader David Littleproud told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). \"I want to see the science.\" 'Not the act of a friend': Australia angry over Trump tariffs Cattle Australia chief e ecutive Will Evans, however, told the ABC he was \"comfortable\" with the decision and that the industry had to \"put faith\" in the department. He added that US was an important trading partner with whom Australia needed to maintain a good relationship. The US is Australia's biggest beef e port market, worth A$14bn (£6.8bn, $9.2bn) last year. Trump singled out the industry when imposing what he called \"reciprocal\" tariffs of at least 10% on all Australian e ports. However, a report by Meat and Livestock Australia released in June found the beef tariff had not hurt trade, which had risen by about a third so far this year. Trump tariffs Trade Australia",

Under the five-year deal, Paramount+ will show all 26 previous seasons of the cartoon and debut 50 new episodes starting this week. The move comes after a months-long bidding war a between major streaming platforms. In recent days, Paramount and its CBS network have faced criticism over the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , which the firm says \"is purely a financial decision\". The deal is worth $1.5bn (£1.1bn), according to the Los Angeles Times. New episodes will first be shown on Paramount's cable channel Comedy Central before streaming on Paramount+. The programme was previously shown on rival streaming platform HBO Ma . The latest season, which was originally slated to start airing from 9 July, was delayed due to contract negotiations.

Some commentators have questioned whether CBS' cancellation of the Late Show after more than three decades was tied to a settlement it agreed with US President Donald Trump. He filed a lawsuit last October, alleging CBS had deceptively edited an interview that aired on its 60 Minutes news programme with his presidential election rival Kamala Harris, to \"tip the scales in favour of the Democratic party\". Paramount said it would pay $16m to settle the suit , but with the money allocated to Trump's future presidential library, not paid to him \"directly or indirectly\".

      "content": "City traders have rate-rigging convictions quashed 2 days ago Share Save Andy Verity & Rachel Clun Financial investigations correspondent & Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Tom Hayes says it \"feels surreal\" to have his conviction quashed Two former City traders who were at the centre of one of the biggest scandals of the financial crisis have had their convictions quashed following a 10-year fight. Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were jailed following trials for manipulating the interest rates used for loans between banks. They were among 19 City traders convicted in the US and UK for manipulating so-called Libor and Euribor interest rates, which are used to set borrowing costs on a range of loans such as mortgages and car finance deals. Following the ruling on Wednesday, Mr Hayes said the conviction had \"destroyed\" his family and that it felt \"surreal\" to be cleared. The Supreme Court's judgement represents a vindication for the traders who have said for 10 years that they were victims of a series of miscarriages of justice. They argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were normal commercial practices in order to appease public anger towards the banks over the financial crisis. After a decade-long battle to clear their names, the Supreme Court ruled the criminal trials of Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo were unfair and overturned their convictions. Speaking outside court, Mr Hayes said the decision had been \"a long time coming\" after his \"cruel and pernicious\" sentence. He spent five and a half years in jail. \"It destroyed my family, [I] missed most of my son's childhood,\" he said, adding that it also led to the end of his marriage. \"For so long I've been an international fugitive...and now I can move on with my life, or try to.\" Asked if he would seek compensation, he told the BBC's World at One that he would seek further legal advice. \"No amount of money gives you back that time, and actually no amount of money would make me feel better about that time,\" he said. 'Crazy e perience' Mr Palombo said it had been \"a crazy e perience\". \"I don't even know how I feel right now,\" he said. \"It's a mi ture of relief, happiness.\" The Serious Fraud Office, which brought the original case against the traders, said it would not seek a retrial. Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo were among a group of traders and brokers prosecuted for rigging interest rates in nine criminal trials in London and New York between 2015 and 2019. Mr Hayes, a former trader at Swiss bank UBS, was the first banker jailed over the scandal in 2015. Originally sentenced to 15 years in prison, he reduced it to 11 years on appeal and was later released in January 2021. Mr Palombo was sentenced to four years in jail in 2019. He was also released in 2021. What was Libor? Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, was a key interest rate used to set borrowing costs for trillions of dollars worth of financial deals It became the focus of allegations of wrongdoing following the financial crisis in 2008 Dozens of City traders were accused of trying to manipulate what level Libor was set at, to help the banks they worked for Libor was phased out after 2021 PA Media Carlo Palombo, centre left, and Tom Hayes, centre right, celebrate after having their convictions overturned. The Libor scandal came to light in 2012, when it was discovered that banks were artificially inflating rates to profit from trading and were also lowering them to mask the troubles they faced following the outbreak of the global financial crisis. The financial crisis began in 2008 and led to the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers. which sent shockwaves through the global financial system, triggering recessions across many countries. The BBC uncovered evidence of a much larger, state-led \"rigging\" of interest rates , under pressure from central banks and governments across the world during the financial crisis. Evidence implicating Downing Street and the Bank of England was suppressed throughout the criminal trials. In 2022, US courts said there was no evidence traders had broken any laws or rules and all the American convictions were quashed - leaving the UK the only country in the world where what they were accused of was criminalised. In the UK, the traders' cases had been blocked from reaching the Supreme Court by the Court of Appeal five times between 2015 and 2019. Lord Leggatt, one of five justices reviewing the case, said jury direction errors made during the trials of the former bankers made the convictions \"unsafe\" and therefore could not stand. \"That misdirection undermined the fairness of the trial,\" he added. However, the court also said there had been \"ample evidence\" for a jury to reasonably conclude Hayes had conspired with others to manipulate submissions used to compile the Libor rate. 'No winners here' Conservative MP Sir David Davis said the judicial system needed a \"shake-up\" following Wednesday's judgement. \"This scapegoating e ercise happened as a result of collusion between the banks and government agencies,\" he said. In a statement, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) acknowledged the judgement and said it had \"determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial\". Mr Hayes' solicitor, Karen Todner, called for a full public inquiry into the convictions, and for the justice system to be reformed. \"Tom has missed out on formative years with his son, time with his family, and the loss of his career and his home,\" she said. \"Time he will never get back\". She added: \"There are no winners here.\" Now the Supreme Court has e onerated Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo, the remaining traders convicted of so-called interest rate \"rigging\" could also apply to have their convictions quashed. Elizabeth Robertson, a lawyer for one of the other convicted traders until 2016, said the ruling could even call into question the convictions of those who pleaded guilty. \"I think the judgement says enough for those that pleaded guilty to have their convictions quashed as well,\" she said.

      "content": "Why were the traders' convictions quashed? 2 days ago Share Save Tom Espiner BBC business reporter Share Save PA Media Carlo Palombo and Tom Hayes had their rate-rigging convictions overturned Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for rate-rigging overturned by the UK's Supreme Court. They were convicted and jailed for manipulating the interest rates used for loans between banks, which dictated borrowing costs for the likes of mortgages and car finance deals. So what is rate-rigging and what happens next? Why were Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo jailed? Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo were among 37 City traders prosecuted for manipulating the rate benchmarks, Libor and Euribor. These were used to track the cost of borrowing cash between banks and to set the interest rates on millions of mortgages and commercial loans. In part they were accused, by their actions, of adding to the 2008 financial crisis, which Mr Hayes said after his conviction was quashed that they had \"literally nothing to do with\". Libor has now been discontinued, while Euribor is being reformed. Mr Hayes was accused of being the \"ringmaster\" of an international fraud conspiracy to influence these rates to benefit the banks' trading. He was the first banker to be jailed for rate-rigging in 2015, and was initially given a 14-year sentence, later reduced to 11 years, of which he served half. Mr Palumbo was jailed for four years in 2019. What did they argue? Mr Hayes did not deny that while at UBS, and subsequently at Citibank, he attempted to manipulate the Libor rate. However, he said that it was common practice at the banks where he worked and that his superiors were aware of what he was doing. He argued he was being made the scapegoat for the actions of an industry. Mr Palombo, a former Barclays trader, also argued that it was normal commercial practice. How wide-spread were rate-rigging convictions? In criminal trials on both sides of the Atlantic from 2015 to 2019, 19 people were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and nine were sent to jail. As they served their time, evidence emerged that central bankers and government officials across the world, including a top adviser at Downing Street at the time, had pressured banks such as theirs to engage in very similar conduct to what they were jailed for - but on a much greater scale. No central banker or government official was prosecuted. Soon after they were released after serving their full jail terms, a US appeal court decided such conduct was not a crime after all; nor even against any rules. The US Department of Justice revoked the charges against Tom Hayes, and the US courts then threw out all similar convictions. But in the UK, they remained convicted criminals. What did Supreme Court rule? After a 10-year legal battle, the Supreme Court ruled that the trials of Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo were unfair and overturned their convictions. In the UK, the traders' cases had been blocked from reaching the Supreme Court by the Court of Appeal five times between 2015 and 2019. But the Supreme Court e onerated Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo, ruling that directions given to the jury at the end of Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo's trials were incorrect, meaning their convictions were found to be unsafe. The Serious Fraud Office, which had brought the case against the traders, said it would not be in the public interest to seek a retrial. What happens next? Mr Hayes told a press conference he might be able to recoup the money confiscated from him. He said he will take advice over claiming compensation. \"I've lived for the last ten years on a 24-hour basis, because I've been unable to plan any aspect of my life,\" he said. He was prosecuted, then jailed, then on licence. \"Now suddenly the vista of freedom and choice and what I might do has been opened up to me.\" Conservative MP David Davies said the \"scape-goating e ercise happened as a result of collusion between the banks and government agencies... and we're not done with that - we'll come back to that in Parliament in the autumn.\" Mr Hayes' solicitor, Karen Todner, called for a full public inquiry into the convictions, and for the justice system to be reformed. \"Tom has missed out on formative years with his son, time with his family, and the loss of his career and his home,\" she said. \"Time he will never get back\". She said the charge against Mr Hayes had been \"hopelessly vague\", the case had taken too long to come to appeal. She said the Serious Fraud Office, alongside bodies such as the Post Office and the RSPCA, should not be able to bring criminal prosecutions, because the \"dual role of investigator and prosecutor creates a substantial conflict of interest, which creates miscarriages of justice\". Ben Rose, the solicitor for Carlo Palombo, said other traders may now be able to \"right the wrong done to them\".",

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the pose of the model and the choice of clothing - including \"large pointed shoes\" which emphasised \"the slenderness of her legs\" - made the advert \"irresponsible\". The watchdog ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form and M&S must ensure all the images it uses do not portray models as unhealthily thin. The retailer has stopped using the advert but said in its response to the advertising regulator that its women's clothing range is inclusive and that it \"responsibly promoted aspirational fashion\". The now-banned image previously appeared on the retailer's app and showed a model wearing a white off the shoulder top and slim-fit trousers as well as the pointed shoes in question. The ASA also said the model's head appeared out of proportion with the rest of her body which further highlighted her small frame. M&S said the model's pose was chosen to portray confidence and ease and not to convey slimness. It also said the shoes selected were for \"stylistic and fashion\" purposes only. The ASA acknowledged that three other M&S adverts were also investigated but were not banned. Although M&S chose to amend and remove the specific images. M&S said that all its models are \"selected not only for their professional suitability but also for their health and wellbeing\". It said it ensures all models are in good health and complied with industry standards to avoid promoting unhealthy body images. 'Toned physique' Earlier this year, fellow retailer Ne t also had an advert for blue skinny jeans banned because the model's pose made her look \"unhealthily thin\". The ASA said the advert emphasised the thinness of the model's legs using camera angles, and deemed it \"irresponsible\". Ne t said it disagreed with the advertising watchdog's decision and said the model, while slim, had a \"healthy and toned physique\". It is not just fashion adverts that have been banned by the ASA recently. Earlier this month, an Instagram post by TV personality Gemma Collins which showcased a weight-loss drug and app was banned. It is illegal to advertise prescription-only weight-loss drugs and Ms Collins' was one of nine adverts banned in a crackdown on this content by the ASA. Ms Collins told the ASA's investigation she accepted her posts had promoted the Yazen weight-loss service and app and she would follow guidance in future.

      "content": "Faisal Islam: Trump's tough tariff tactics are getting results 2 days ago Share Save Faisal Islam Economics editor, BBC News • @faisalislam Share Save Getty Images Japan is a big deal for President Donald Trump's upheaval of the world's trading system. On his own terms, it could now be said that his aggressive approach is yielding tangible results. Right from the off, the US side has been talking up the chances of a deal with Japan, but despite several delegations, the deal had been strangely elusive - until now. In a narrow sense, this is a win for the Trump approach, especially if Japan becomes the domino that leads the rest of the world to come into line. Japan now has the best deal, or rather, the least worst deal, of all the nations with major trade surpluses with the US. The general tariff of 15% to be charged on Japanese goods being imported to the US is higher than the UK's 10%, but the UK has no surplus. As I've reported before, the fury of the Japanese negotiators during talks was noted among Washington DC diplomats accustomed to the nation's e treme politeness. Trump says US has struck trade deal with Japan What the US-Japan deal means for Asia and the world Tokyo was playing hardball. The Japanese finance minister described the nation's $1.1 trillion holding of US Treasury bonds, the largest in the world, as a \"card\" that could be put on the table. It was rumours about hedge funds in Japan dumping US bonds following Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement in April that sparked a wider sell-off, and bigger questions over the world's biggest economy and safe haven status of the US dollar. So the reaching of a deal matters hugely, in and of itself, and as an e ample to other major economic blocs, including the European Union (EU). The deal comes on the day the Japanese host EU leaders in Tokyo. There had been some chatter about Japan, the EU and Canada coordinating their retaliation. This stops any such initiative. Some members of the EU will wonder why a similar deal cannot be struck, at the very moment that Germany and France up the ante on retaliation, perhaps against the US tech giants. The world awaits the details here, but it is clear that Japan has protected its agricultural imports, though will import more US rice. It is unclear what can change the lack of popularity of large American cars in the country, though Japanese private companies will be backed to invest half a trillion dollars in the US, in some form. Japan has done this deal when it might have waited out to see how things develop and international markets react when Trump's tougher tariffs for a host of countries come into force on 1 August. The domestic political weakness of its Prime Minister may have been a factor, though other countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines have also done deals. The big picture though is a weary acceptance of the US levying what would have been a year ago unthinkable tariffs on its major allies, for fear of something worse. In Japan's case it was a 25% tariff threatened by Trump. Tariff revenue rising for the US Tariffs are now raising significant sums for the US Treasury, without retaliation against US e porters. At over $100bn so far this year, about 5% of US federal revenue is coming from tariffs, versus 2% more typically. The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent thinks that the annual tariff take will be $300bn. It is way off the amount raised by income ta es, but a notable amount. It is being taken without direct retaliation and without right now the market turmoil seen earlier. However, the story does not end here. Who is actually paying these tariffs? Ultimately US consumers will pay a large part in terms of the prices they pay for imported goods. In the past Bessent and others have suggested that a rising value of the US dollar would help mitigate the cost of imports for consumers. The opposite has happened. The dollar has slumped in the first half of this year, losing 10% of its value against a basket of world currencies. This will add to the cost of imports, in addition to the tariffs. There is a wider canvas here too. The governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey said this week that \"the most crowded trade in the market at the moment is 'short dollar'\". He added that established safe haven patterns in markets, especially the US dollar, were \"essentially breaking down\". There is a \"reduction of e posure\" to the dollar as companies and traders now take out trades or \"hedges\" designed to ensure they are protected against its decline,\" the governor said. As I've discussed before, there is suspicion in the markets that this weaker dollar may actually have been part of the point of these interventions, designed to help boost, for e ample, American rust-belt manufacturers regain competitiveness. On top of that, the US has also helped its great rival China to at least make a case to the rest of the world, that it can be a more stable trade partner. For this first stage of the great global trade war, Japan is an important win for the White House, which will push back against the suggestion that \"Trump always chickens out\" or TACO. While it could also translate into more apparent wins ahead of next week's deadlines, driving further market euphoria, the broader economic picture remains far murkier.

In his first interview since the release of a report into the fire at a nearby electrical substation, Thomas Woldbye said it wasn't typically the way he acted. \"It's not how I normally operate but on an operational level all the right things happened,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Woldbye admitted that the power outage, which disrupted flights for 270,000 passengers, would cost \"millions\" but declined to specify how much. Results from Heathrow revealed that pre-ta profit fell by 37.2% to £203m in the first si months of 2025. A review into the incident by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly found that Mr Woldbye missed two emergency notifications and \"several\" phone calls on the night of the fire and the subsequent power outage because his mobile phone had gone into \"silent mode\". In the early hours of 21 March, Heathrow took the decision to stop operations at the airport. Mr Woldbye became aware of what had happened at around 6:45am. He told the BBC he was satisfied with the crisis management procedures that were in place and went into action while he was sleeping. \"Of course, an organisation like ours has to be able to manage whether the captain's on the bridge or not and in this particular case we took the right decisions,\" he said. An investigation into how the fire started at an electrical substation which supplied power to Heathrow discovered that it was the result of a known fault at the site. National Grid, which owns the substation, had been aware of a problem since 2018 but failed to fi it. As the results of the investigation by the National Energy Systems Operator (NESO) were published, Heathrow said it was considering legal action against National Grid. Heathrow uses as much electricity as a small city, and it has three connections to the grid. In Heathrow's results, which showed a 1.9% rise in revenues to £1.7bn, it said the NESO report found \"clear failings by National Grid Electricity Transmission that resulted in a loss for both Heathrow and airlines.\" It added: \"Our e pectation is that [National Grid] takes accountability for these failings.\" More on this story Heathrow considering legal action against National Grid over fire Five things we now know about the fire that shut Heathrow down London Heathrow Airport Air travel",

Japan Inc Japan is the world's fourth largest economy, meaning it accounts for a large part of global trade and growth. Tokyo imports a great deal of energy and food from overseas and is dependent on e ports including electronics, machinery and motor vehicles. The US is its biggest e port market. Some experts had warned that Trump's tariffs could knock as much as a percentage point off Japan's economy, pushing it into recession. With lower tariffs, e porters will be able to do business in the US more cheaply than if Trump had stuck to an earlier threat to levy higher ta es. And the deal brings certainty, which allows businesses to plan. Trump says US has struck trade deal with Japan The announcement also strengthened the Japanese yen against the US dollar, giving manufacturers more purchasing power to buy the raw materials they need to e pand their businesses. The US agreement is particularly good for Japan's auto giants like Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Previously, American importers had to pay a 27.5% levy when they shipped in Japanese cars. That is now being reduced to 15%, potentially making Japanese cars cheaper compared to the likes of rival China. Having said that, US automakers have signalled they are unhappy with the deal. They are concerned they have to pay a 25% tariff on imports from their plants and suppliers in Canada and Me ico compared with Japan's 15% rate. Jobs and more deals In return for reduced tariffs, Japan has proposed investing $550bn in the US to enable Japanese firms \"to build resilient supply chains in key sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors,\" Ishiba said. Japan is already a major investor in the US, but this amount of money should create jobs, make quality products and foster innovation. Under the deal, Trump said Japan will increase purchases of agricultural products such as US rice which could help the country's rice shortage - even if it might rattle local farmers concerned about losing market share. The 15% tariff is also a benchmark for other countries like South Korea and Taiwan who are holding their own trade negotiations with the US. Getty Images Japan will buy rice from America, according to Donald Trump South Korea's industry minister said he will take a close look at the terms of what Japan has agreed with the US as he headed to Washington for crunch trade talks. Japan and South Korea compete in industries like steel and autos. More broadly, the US and Japan deal will put more pressure on other countries - especially major Asia e porters - to secure better agreements before a 1 August deadline. Deals with Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines have already been announced. But some Asian countries will suffer. Smaller economies like Cambodia, Laos and Sri Lanka are manufacturing e porters and they have little to offer Washington in terms of trade or investment. Did the US get what it wants? There were reports that the US had called on Japan to increase military spending. But Tokyo's tariff envoy has clarified that the deal does not include anything on defence spending. Ryosei Akazawa added that steel and aluminium tariffs would remain at 50%. These both may be wins for Japan, since it e ports more vehicles to the US than it does steel and aluminium. The pressure is also on the US to get as many of these deals over the line before its self-imposed tariff August deadline. Alongside negotiations with the US, countries might start looking for more reliable partners elsewhere. On the same day as Washington and Toyko announced their agreement, Japan and Europe pledged to \"work more closely together to counter economic coercion and to address unfair trade practices,\" according European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The European Union is yet to agree a trade deal with the US. \"We believe in global competitiveness and it should benefit everyone,\" said Ms von der Leyen. International Business Trump tariffs",

Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA Reeves risks missing fiscal targets and should consider ta rises, says IMF Chancellor’s plans could be knocked off course by global crisis, poor growth or interest rate shocks, report says Business live – latest updates The International Monetary Fund has said the UK government risks being knocked off course in meeting its targets to repair the public finances and urged Rachel Reeves to give herself more leeway through ta or spending measures. In a final version of an annual report on the UK economy, the Washington-based organisation said changes introduced by the chancellor to the government’s deficit reduction plans had enhanced the credibility and effectiveness of fiscal policy. “Risks to this strategy must be carefully managed. In an uncertain global environment and with limited fiscal headroom, fiscal rules could easily be breached if growth disappoints or interest rate shocks materialise,” the IMF said. Help wanted: Reeves seeks heavyweight economic advisers as budget looms Read more The fund also said the risk of overly frequent changes to ta and spending policy could be reduced by measures including the creation of more fiscal room for manoeuvre by Reeves to meet her targets. “The first best (option) would be to maintain more headroom under the rules, so that small changes in the outlook do not compromise assessments of rule compliance,” it said. The IMF said that delivering Reeves’s plans to increase economic growth “involves significant challenges given limited fiscal space, the breadth of the reforms, and the volatile e ternal environment” amid the US president Donald Trump’s trade war. In its May report, the IMF said Reeves should refine her fiscal rules to prevent the need for emergency spending cuts. Since then the government’s high-stakes welfare U-turn has put further pressure on the public finances, and Reeves prepares for a tough autumn budget amid mounting speculation over the need for large ta rises . skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion In response to Friday’s report, Reeves said that the fund had backed her choices for the UK economy to recover and her plans would “tackle the deep-rooted economic challenges that we inherited in the face of global headwinds”. Reeves is under pressure to raise ta es later this year to remain on course to meet her budget targets, having already increased social security contributions paid by employers and along with revenue-raising measures in late 2024.

Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters A fifth of California homes are investor-owned as state’s affordability crisis deepens – report New figures show that the Golden state’s rate of investor-owned homes is 19%, with mountain regions up to 83% One in five homes in California is owned by investors, new data reveals, in the latest sign of an affordability crisis that shows no end in sight. The figures, which come from the data tracker BatchData and were analyzed by the Orange County Register , show that California’s overall percentage of investor home ownership sits at 19%. The rate is higher in the state’s mountain regions such as Sierra county, which has an 83% share of its homes owned by investors, compared with coastal Ventura county, at just 14%. In seven California counties – Sierra, Trinity, Mono, Alpine, Plumas, Modoc and Calaveras – investors owned more than 50% of homes. Why is the number of first-time US homebuyers at a generational low? Read more California’s most urban counties, featuring some of its most prized and e pensive real estate, had lower shares of investor-owned homes, with Los Angeles county at 15% and San Francisco, San Diego and Orange counties at 16%. While the trend is not unique to California – the state ranks 36th in the country, and just a shade under the 20% national average – it comes as the state is e periencing an acute housing shortage. Home prices in the Golden state are among the most e pensive in the nation, and have jumped 50% in the past si years. The US Chamber of Commerce estimates that the US is short roughly 4.5m homes . The share of investor-owned homes is rising as well, accounting for 26.8% of all national residential property sales in the first quarter of 2025. While this indicated the highest percentage in five years, BatchData attributed the number less to increasing investor activity, and more to rising costs of home ownership serving as a barrier for homebuyers. The doubling of mortgage rates in 2022 significantly cut homebuyer purchases, thus increasing investors’ share. The report, which did not define what qualifies as an “investor”, saw the sector filling a crucial role in tight markets. “With traditional buyers sidelined by affordability constraints, investors are providing essential marked liquidity while targeting distinct property segments and geographic markets,” the report said. Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the Institute for Policy Studies and co-author of Billionaire Blowback on Housing , says the “mega investors and small investors” want to “make as much money as possible”. Ocampo is not sold that this helps make housing affordable. “They bring liquidity into the market because they’re pouring billions of dollars of cash into real estate, but that is not putting downward pressure on prices,” he said. “We would argue that’s putting upward pressure on prices.” Ocampo acknowledged a shortage of housing, but said that, given investment patterns, an affordability solution would take more than just building new units. “What happens if you build more housing, and institutional investors are buying up 20% of the new stock?” Ocampo said. “It’s like a never-ending cycle.” Tourist-heavy states Hawaii and Alaska clocked in with the highest share of investor-owned homes with 40% and 35%, respectively. Affordable states such as Arkansas (30%) and West Virginia (30%) also ranked highly. By quantity, California had the second highest number of investor-owned homes in the country (1.45m) after Te as (1.66m), with Florida clinching the bronze medal at 1.21m. Investors owing between one and five properties account for 85% of investor-owned homes, and those owning between si and 10 properties account for another 5%, bringing the total share of small investor-owned homes to about 90%.

Photograph: Abdul Saboor/Reuters The Guardian view on global inequality: the rising tide that leaves most boats behind Editorial The world’s assets are piling up in the hands of the few as growth is built on widening gaps. That’s not just unfair – it’s economically unsustainable T his year’s global wealth report by the City bank UBS confirms what is self-evident but rarely confronted: while riches are accumulating, their distribution remains starkly unbalanced. In the 56 countries and economic areas surveyed, the report says global personal wealth grew 4.6% in 2024. However, not all boats have been lifted by this tide. The gap is growing between those who hold assets and those who don’t. The figures are shocking: just 60m of the world’s adults – 1.6% of the population – have net personal wealth of $226tn, or 48.1% of all the world’s riches. At the other e treme, four in 10 adults – 1.57bn people – have only $2.7tn, or just 0.6% of all the world’s personal wealth. Economists now argue that inequality is no longer a by-product of growth but a condition of it. In the US, soaring bond markets and tech stocks have benefited the ultra-rich and deepened inequality. Nine households, it was reported , control 15% of wealth in Silicon Valley. By contrast, UBS says British median wealth rose while average wealth fell. This is a rare divergence, probably caused by prosperous households in London taking a hit from interest rate hikes as house prices dropped and debt costs rose. This wasn’t a sign of shared prosperity but of paper losses at the top, while ordinary workers held steady. Unlike wages, wealth reflects not just income but also access to assets, favourable institutional conditions – such as low interest rates – and public policies like low ta es and housing shortages. In other words, wealth depends on political choices in ways that income currently does not. It’s not just the inequality itself that is the issue but the erosion of mechanisms that once constrained it. As the report notes, wealth and income inequality are linked. But where wages have stagnated and collective bargaining has weakened, capital income – derived from profits, rents and interest – has been boosted by design. Productivity gains , once e pected to feed through to broader living standards, now primarily serve to enhance returns to wealth. Ta es on wealth are necessary to make societies more equal. Unfairness is aiding far-right autocrats whose rise brings the risk of democratic collapse . In July seven Nobel laureates issued a powerful call for a minimum ta on the ultra-rich. Brazil, Spain and South Africa have demanded a global ta on the super-rich, placing the issue on the G20 agenda. Pioneering work by economists such as Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez led to the French national assembly passing a law this year for a 2% minimum ta on wealth over €100m. The legislation, regrettably, has not proceeded past the senate. Progressive ta ation is necessary, but it doesn’t address a core problem in many economies: when capital income outpaces labour income, redistribution may ease the symptoms of neoliberalism, but it leaves the underlying condition untreated. High inequality suppresses consumption, deters investment and slows growth . The gap between rich and poor is not just unfair – it’s economically unsustainable. Without strong domestic demand, economies increasingly rely on debt, speculation and asset bubbles to fuel growth. Changing this would take more than fiscal transfers. It would require policies that boost wages: full employment, stronger labour unions and public investment. Private ownership itself may need to be reconceived – less perhaps in the sense of e propriation, and more in terms of widening access to productive assets and social wealth.

Photograph: Heiko Becker/Reuters Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature Live feed From 24h ago 16.12 CEST Closing summary: ECB in a 'good place' amid Trump threats Christine Lagarde appeared to be in relatively rela ed mood this afternoon as she took questions from the press pack in Frankfurt: she said the European Central Bank is in a “good place” – or as good as it can be with the threat of Donald Trump’s tariffs. The ECB will be “data-dependent” on whether the next move in interest rates is up or down, she said repeatedly. She said that the prospect of a 15% tariffs between the EU and US remained “conjecture”, but suggested the ECB would not e clude any actions depending on what happens with the trade war. David Rea , chief economist for Europe at JLL , a property company, said: The ECB’s decision to hold rates indicates it is keeping its powder dry as the economic situation continues to evolve. The bank is already significantly ahead of most central banks in terms of rates cut, and so the continuation of the neutral policy now means the ECB is in a good position to move rates in whichever direction necessary in future without the need for large swings. Charlie Cornes , senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research , said: While inflationary pressures have eased considerably and the growth outlook for the Eurozone still relatively subdued, there is impetus for the ECB to move further with its loosening cycle. That said, uncertainty amidst ongoing trade negotiations with the US are holding the ECB back. Maintaining its commitment to price stability, the ECB is likely to proceed cautiously. As such, we e pect that the ECB will conduct only one further rate cut before the end of 2025. In other business news: President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would not destroy Elon Musk ’s companies by taking away federal subsidies and that he wants the billionaire tech-entrepreneur’s businesses to thrive. “Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon’s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government. This is not so!,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE.” Tesla sales in Europe have collapsed by one-third this year , data shows, after Elon Musk warned the electric carmaker faced “a few rough quarters” ahead. Donald Trump will heap further pressure on the chief of the Federal Reserve , Jerome Powell, on Thursday when the US president makes a visit to the central bank’s Washington offices. UK businesses are cutting jobs at the fastest pace since February in response to higher ta es and global uncertainty caused by Donald Trump’s tariff threats. Britain may have lower gas stockpiles going into the winter after the owner of British Gas indicated it plans to sell its stored gas to help reduce losses at a North Sea gas storage facility.

Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters: S&P 500 UP 11.91 POINTS, OR 0.19 %, AT 6,370.82 DOW JONES DOWN 314.67 POINTS, OR 0.70%, AT 44,695.62 NASDAQ UP 80.58 POINTS, OR 0.38%, AT 21,100.59 1d ago 15.32 CEST It is not possible to have more anticipation of the future rate path at this point because of the uncertainty around the trade war, says Christine Lagarde . We will just have to wait and see, Lagarde says – before wishing everyone a rest as Europe heads on its holidays. 1d ago 15.24 CEST A German ECB member argued last week that there was a “high bar” for future interest rate cuts . Christine Lagarde says that while some members of the ECB’s governing council have different preferences, there was a “unanimous decision to keep interest rates unchanged. Could rates even go up? If trade tensions are resolved in short order it will clear some of the uncertainty that we have weighing on decisions, she says: Could it lead to different movements? Future will tell. Our work will tell. I will not e clude anything. 1d ago 15.19 CEST The jury is out as to how quickly the uncertainty will be cleared, says Christine Lagarde , referring to the trade war launched by Donald Trump. On the ECB’s position, she says: You could argue that we are on hold. We are in this wait and watch situation. Asked about the US’s push to dominate the market for stablecoins , Lagarde says the eurozone is pushing to create its own digital euro, but: Cash will always be there, and banks will still be there intermediating the process. 1d ago 15.14 CEST Asked if there is a risk of undershooting on the inflation target, Christine Lagarde points out that the ECB is forecasting an undershoot. However, the central bank will not deviate from its plans on the basis of minor movements in inflation figures, she says – they will focus on 2% over the medium term, rather than worrying about dipping below 2% temporarily. Asked about retaliatory tariffs, Lagarde says the ECB is looking at different rates of retaliatory tariffs in various scenarios – but it is too complicated to work out what will happen yet. For the moment the ECB assumes the trade war will be inflationary, but there could also be bottlenecks and supply chain changes which will all come together to impact prices, she says: There is a lot of uncertainty out there… At this point in time the conclusion is not definite as to which of those forces will prevail. 1d ago 15.09 CEST We are in a good place because inflation is at 2%, says Christine Lagarde . Wages are heading in the right direction and are showing a downward trend as e pected, she says. We have seen growth developing in a relatively favourable way, she adds. She repeats caveats about the relative strength of first-quarter growth, noting again the “front-loading” of companies to get ahead of US tariffs. Nevertheless, she says there was also some consumption supporting growth. And she appears comfortable with lower rates: The inflationary shock of the past few years is behind us. Our job is now to look at what’s coming. 1d ago 15.04 CEST The sooner US-EU trade uncertainty diminishes, the better, says ECB's Lagarde Asked about e change rates, Christine Lagarde says the ECB does not target a particular e change rate. On the US’s trade talks with the EU, Lagarde says reports the two sides are reaching a deal are still “conjecture”. However, “We are attentive to where the negotiations are heading”, she says. We take news one day at a time and at the moment we are relying on our baseline models from June, Lagarde says. The sooner this trade uncertainty is resolved… the less uncertainty we will have to deal with. That would be welcome by any economic actors, including ourselves. 1d ago 15.00 CEST The ECB will follow a “data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach”, Christine Lagarde repeats. The ECB’s governing council is determined to keep inflation at its 2% target, she adds. And with that she will take questions. 1d ago 14.56 CEST Risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside, Christine Lagarde says – hardly a surprise when Donald Trump is looking at the US’s relationship with the EU. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the “tragic” conflict in the Middle East also add to uncertainty, she says. The path of inflation is more uncertain than normal because of the trade tensions, she says. Inflation could be higher if trade disruption disrupts supply chains, she adds, as happened during the coronavirus pandemic. 1d ago 14.53 CEST Higher investment in defence and infrastructure should support growth, Christine Lagarde says. She repeats the endless call of ECB officials to strengthen integration of the eurozone and its banking system. And then she goes into the easing inflationary pressures. Forward-looking indicators point to a further decline in wage growth, and consumer inflation expectations declined recently, she says. 1d ago 14.50 CEST Christine Lagarde takes to the podium in Frankfurt after leaving interest rates unchanged. She starts by reading out the decision. The economy grew more strongly than e pected as companies “front-loaded” e ports to avoid tariff hikes, but growth was also bostered by consumption, she says. Higher e pected tariffs, a stronger euro and persistent uncertainty are making firms unwilling to invest, she says. 1d ago 14.44 CEST Could 2% be the end of the road for the latest rate cutting cycle? Mark Wall , chief European economist at Deutsche Bank , said: As effectively telegraphed by Lagarde, the ECB paused the easing cycle in July. The question is, will this be a short pause or a long pause? And could this be a pause that sees 2% policy rates eventually become the terminal rate in this easing cycle? Uncertainty remains high and the ECB rightly wants to keep its options open. But if trade uncertainty fades, the combination of a resilient economy and significant fiscal easing will eventually translate into upside risks to inflation. Markets are not far away from switching focus from the last cut to the first hike. We will hear what Christine Lagarde has to say very shortly. 1d ago 14.32 CEST There is very little reason for the ECB to leave its “good place” of standing on the sidelines waiting for more trade developments, said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING , an investment bank. In a note to clients, he said: After seven consecutive 25 basis point [0.25 percentage point] rate cuts and a total of 200 basis point rate cuts since September 2023, the European Central Bank kept its policy interest rates on hold at today’s meeting. A stronger euro had argued for further cuts, Brzeski said, but that pressure diminished as the euro eased. Not only did the euro’s appreciation come to an end, but the repeatedly postponed showdown in the US-EU trade negotiations also offered another reason to stay put today and keep the powder dry. Still, with two more weaker inflation prints and hard macro data weaker than soft data over the summer, we can still see one final rate cut at the September meeting.

Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA European Central Bank keeps interest rates on hold despite sluggish growth Central bank shuns calls to reduce borrowing costs as higher US tariffs loom Business live – latest updates The European Central Bank has kept interest rates on hold as figures showed the eurozone economy maintaining a steady pace of economic growth amid low inflation. In what was widely e pected to be a pause before further cuts later in the year, the Frankfurt-based central bank shunned calls to reduce the cost of borrowing and held its main interest rate at 2% and the deposit rate at 2.15%. The ECB’s president, Christine Lagarde, said the eurozone was in “a good place” and that the cost of living crisis was in the past. “Our job is now to look at what is coming,” she added. The ECB, which has cut interest rates eight times in the last nine months from a high of 4%, is watching to see how the EU is affected by higher tariffs on goods e ported to the US, which are e pected to be part of a trade deal between Washington and Brussels. This month, Donald Trump threatened a 30% tariff on goods imported from the EU as part of his high-stakes global trade war. Financial markets are hopeful of a deal before the deadline of 1 August after the US reached an agreement to limit tariff increases with Japan on Tuesday. Central Bank officials are also concerned that an economic slowdown could be married to a drop in prices should China and other east and south-east Asian countries, also hit by US tariffs, dump cheap goods in European markets. A rise in the value of the euro against a basket of other currencies is likely to make imports to the eurozone cheaper, which could also bring down inflationary pressures. Lagarde said the risks to the economy remained “tilted to the downside” and that among the main threats to growth were a worsening of the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine and global trade tensions that could “dampen e ports and drag down investment and consumption”. However, she said the ECB was “well-positioned to wait and see” because inflation was at 2% and that the central bank’s projections pointed to the rate stabilising at that level in the medium term. Lagarde added: “Wage increases are coming down and growth has been developing in a relatively favourable way. It means we are now confident that the inflation shock of the past few years is behind us and our job is to look at what is coming.” Mathieu Savary, the chief strategist at BCA Research, said July’s decision could be a pause before steep cuts in rates at future meetings to prevent the eurozone economy from stalling and head off a period of deflation. He said: “The ECB stood pat today, but this pause is not the end of the story. Disinflation is already deeply entrenched across the eurozone. Now, with a stronger euro, looming US tariffs, and intensifying Chinese competition, the region faces a new threat: deflation. “The [ECB] governing council may soon find itself forced to cut rates more aggressively than markets currently anticipate.” skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion In its report, the ECB said: “The economy has so far proven resilient overall in a challenging global environment. At the same time, the environment remains e ceptionally uncertain, especially because of trade disputes.” Financial markets e pect the the central bank to hold rates at its next meeting in September before cuts resume again in December. The July decision came after surveys of the private sector across the 20-member currency bloc showed a modest rise in output despite a long period of stagnation in its two largest economies of France and Germany. Most countries in the eurozone have historically low levels of unemployment and low inflation, giving them a strong platform for growth. However, the threat of increased tariff from Washington , and a possible 50% levy on e ports of steel to the US, has caused many firms to hold back investment and new hiring. Annual inflation in the eurozone was 2% in June, up from 1.9% in May. US inflation rose to 2.7% in June from 2.4% in the previous month while inflation hit 3.6% in the UK in June .

The flash S&P Global purchasing managers’ inde (PMI) for July showed a decline in fresh orders, hitting jobs and dragging down growth. According to the report: “Survey respondents widely commented on the need to reduce headcounts in response to higher payroll costs and subdued customer demand.” Posing a dilemma for the Bank of England as inflation remains above its target, the early snapshot of activity this month showed manufacturing growth was static while sales in the services sector weakened. Central bank officials meet in a fortnight and are widely e pected to cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4% to lift the UK’s stuttering economy. Surveys of UK businesses have shown that e tra employment ta es in the last budget and Trump’s tariff threats have slowed the economy. The most recent official estimates show the economy contracted in April and May. The latest figures showed unemployment nudged up to 4.7% in May , hitting the highest level in four years, while wage growth slowed for a third consecutive month, and employers cut back on hiring. However, inflation is running at 3.4%, above the Bank’s 2% target. Threadneedle Street has forecast that prices growth is unlikely to fall significantly until next year. According to James Smith, an economist at ING, the latest survey figures “perfectly encapsulate the headache the Bank of England faces right now”. The flash S&P Global PMI, which covers the services and manufacturing sectors, dropped from 52 to 51 in July. A figure above 50 indicates e pansion. Most of the drop was blamed on the services sector, which fell from 52.8 to 51.2, while the manufacturing output inde rose to 50. Smith said: “Higher payroll ta es and a chunky rise in the national living wage back in April are e erting more significant downward pressure on staffing numbers, according to the latest PMI. “But the PMI also suggests these policy changes are keeping upward pressure on prices. We’ve seen hints of this in the [inflation] data, principally in food, where inflation rates have picked up over and above what we’ve seen in the eurozone. Pressure on staffing costs also likely e plains the stickiness in hospitality inflation through the spring.’ skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The PMI report said e port sales decreased for the ninth consecutive month, “albeit to the least marked e tent since January”. Firms said the uncertainty created by Trump’s tariff threats was a factor along with competition from Chinese companies shut out of the US by high levies on many goods. Looking ahead, businesses said they e pected the global turmoil to calm down and interest rates to fall, making them optimistic about the next 12 months. They also predicted that a recent increase in household savings would reverse and that the more benign outlook would encourage consumers to begin spending again. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the survey showed the UK economy was struggling to e pand as it moved into the second half of the year. “Output growth weakened to a pace indicative of the economy growing at a mere 0.1% quarterly rate, with risks tilted to the downside in the coming months,” he said.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Lloyds boss warns Reeves against hiking ta es on banks as profits rise 17% Charlie Nunn says higher ta ation would be inconsistent with chancellor’s drive for growth Business live – updates The boss of Britain’s largest mortgage lender has warned Rachel Reeves that increasing ta es on banks in her autumn budget would damage Labour’s plan for the City of London to power an economic recovery. Charlie Nunn, the chief e ecutive of Lloyds Banking Group , said a rise in bank ta ation “wouldn’t be consistent” with the chancellor’s overtures as the government pushes to reboot growth. Against a backdrop of mounting speculation that Reeves could use her autumn budget to announce a fresh round of ta rises, his comments came as the high street bank reported a 17% jump in second-quarter profits. BoE governor warns Reeves weakening banking rules risks repeat of 2008 crisis Read more Nunn told journalists on Thursday the bank had not had any discussions with the government about a potential ta rise, and acknowledged that it was ultimately a “political decision”. However, he said that targeting the financial services sector with higher ta es would mark a stark reversal by the chancellor, who last week announced a raft of changes to cut regulation and increase growth across the sector. He said Reeves had made the case for a “strong financial services sector” to support the UK economy, and had highlighted that the industry had a “huge role to play” in terms of supporting households and businesses. “We definitely believe that’s an important thing to focus on, and obviously, therefore, [it] wouldn’t be consistent with a ta rise,” Nunn said. He added that the UK already had “the highest ta regime on the financial services sector of any major economy”. Banks currently face the 25% headline rate of corporate ta , as well as a 3% bank surcharge and a further bank levy, which is a charge on a portion of balance sheet assets. However, the Conservatives cut the bank surcharge, from 8% to 3%, in April 2023 in a move decried by opposition MPs as a costly giveaway. This month, analysts at Deutsche Bank speculated that Reeves could reverse the cut to raise about £1.5bn . Labour has placed financial services among its eight key sectors to receive government backing in its industrial strategy, while industry lobbyists have warned the chancellor that e tra help is required to bolster the City after Bre it. Estimates by the lobby group UK Finance and the accountancy firm PwC suggest that, when also accounting for employment ta es and VAT, banks in the UK are paying a total ta rate of about 45.8%. That compares with 38.6% in Frankfurt, and 27.9% in New York. “We’re proud of being one of the or the biggest ta payer in the UK as Lloyds Banking Group,” Nunn said. “So we are completely comfortable with that. But it is important when you look at the competitiveness of the City of London and the financial services sector that we remain a competitive ta regime.” skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Raising ta es on banks would also add to costs at a time when many lenders – including Lloyds – are bracing for a hefty compensation bill over the car finance commission scandal. A supreme court ruling is widely e pected within the next week. Lloyds has put aside £1.2bn in provisions to cover potential costs. Updating the City on its second-quarter performance, the bank reported a 17% rise in pre-ta profits to nearly £2bn, up from £1.7bn in the same period last year. The increase was driven in part by higher fees from its pension, insurance and investments business. When asked whether he shared Reeves’ view, e pressed during her Mansion House speech last week, saying that regulation was acting like a “boot on the neck” of business, Nunn said: “That’s very much for the chancellor to use that language.” However, the added that he believed there was a “real opportunity to align regulation, increasingly, with competitiveness and growth.” Among the proposals welcomed by the Lloyds boss are plans in the coming months to review ringfencing rules , which are the post-financial crisis regulations meant to protect consumer cash from a bank’s riskier business activities. Bank bosses including Nunn had lobbied for ringfencing to be abolished, arguing the rule was redundant as a result of other safeguards brought in after the 2008 banking crisis.

In an unusual move, the White House announced on Wednesday that Trump would visit the Fed at 4pm on the following day, without saying whether Powell would meet him. Since the US president’s inauguration in January he has repeatedly attacked Powell for refusing to cut interest rates. Fed pushes back on White House claims of e travagant renovations Read more Powell chairs a committee that has voted to maintain the cost of borrowing while many other central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, have made cuts. Trump recently accused Powell of making it difficult for young people to buy a house while interest rates remained high, referring to him as a “numbskull” in social media posts and suggesting his tenure, due to run until next spring, should be curtailed. Trump’s public criticism of Powell and suggestions that he could be fired have rattled markets amid concerns about the central bank’s independence and freedom from political interference. A refurbishment of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters has also become a subject of dispute after a $1.9bn (£1.4bn) project reportedly overran by about $600m. White House officials have claimed that Powell’s oversight of the project shows the Fed boss lacks the ability to run the organisation. The Fed has hit back, e plaining in a video tour of the construction that the project is a “complete overhaul and modernisation” of two buildings that have not had major renovations since the 1930s. Trump’s visit – part of an investigation of the project – represents an acceleration of the pressure that he and his advisers have put on Powell and the bank. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has played down the likelihood of ousting Powell, but this week questioned whether the Federal Reserve had fulfilled its mandate.

Photograph: Davide Bonaldo/Sopa Images/Shutterstock EU and US nearing trade deal that would put 15% tariffs on imports from bloc Rate would apply to most goods but bloc still hardening retaliatory measures in case Trump does not agree deal The EU and the US are nearing a trade deal that would place 15% tariffs on most imports from the bloc, it has emerged. The tariff rate, which would mirror a deal struck this week between the US and Japan , would apply to most goods, with some e ceptions for products including aircraft and medical devices, according to diplomats with knowledge of the talks. Member states were briefed on the latest developments by the European Commission on Wednesday afternoon. To e tract a better deal, the EU has also offered to reduce its so-called “most-favoured-nation rate” – currently at an average of 4.8% - to zero for some products as part of an agreement in principle, a diplomat said. The final decision remains in the hands of the US president, Donald Trump , but if agreed it would mean the EU gets a worse deal than the UK, which has agreed a 10% baseline tariff. It would also be a hard pill to swallow for the German car industry, whose tariffs would be reduced from 27.5% but would still be more than five times the 2.75% import duty they faced on e ports to the US before Trump returned to the White House. Although e emptions would have to be finalised, it is understood that alcoholic spirits are also under consideration to be further reduced or removed, which would be a win for whiskey and cognac e porters in the EU and bourbon e porters in the US. Sources also said a 15% tariff would include the most-favoured nation tariff and would not be stacked on top of existing import duties faced by various sectors. Discussion about any possible trade deals with the US should be considered “speculation,” unless they are announced byTrump, White House spokesman Kush Desai said on Wednesday. At the same time as the talks, the EU is hardening its retaliatory measures in the event Trump does not sign the deal, which would amount to a baseline tariff at half the 30% rate he threatened 10 days ago. On Wednesday the EU threatened to impose nearly €100bn (£87bn) worth of tariffs on US imports ranging from bourbon to Boeing aircraft in one fell swoop if the US president walks away from the latest proposal. Diplomatic sources have said the rate would be set at 30% to match that of Trump’s threat with a vote at the European council trade barriers committee tomorrow. At the same time EU diplomats discussed using the “nuclear deterrent”, a new law known as the anti-coercion instrument, which could allow the bloc to impose tariffs, but also ban US services which would hit the tech industry hard. It could take a year to implement. Sources say, however, that France was the only country that called for the immediate implementation of the instrument, arguing it had to demonstrate it was tough. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The European Commission said on Wednesday it planned to combine two previously prepared lists of US goods to be included in any retaliatory moves against the US president’s border ta es. If Brussels follows through on the threat, it would mean tariffs would be imposed on US imports to the EU from the first €21bn list, which includes poultry and alcohol, as well as the more recent list of €72bn of goods, which features cars and planes. If agreed by EU member states, through a vote e pected in the coming days, the €93bn of counter-tariffs could be imposed from 7 August. “The EU’s primary focus is on achieving a negotiated outcome with the US,” said Olof Gill, a trade spokesperson for the European Commission, adding that it would “continue in parallel to prepare for all outcomes”. To make countermeasures “clearer, simpler and stronger we will merge lists 1 and 2 into a single list”, he said. Tobias Gehrke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said the EU had missed an opportunity by not warning that it would use the ACI after a trade ministers’ summit early last week, two days after Trump sent it a letter threatening 30% tariffs. “There is a sense that the bloc has fumbled its hand, despite holding decent cards,” he said. “The EU should have immediately retaliated against US tariffs. While the mantra ‘negotiate from a position of strength’ was oft-repeated in speeches, any associated actions never materialised.” The latest EU move comes before a summit with China on Thursday between the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU council, António Costa, and China’s president, i Jinping.

Photograph: Franck Robichon/EPA Markets rally after Trump announces tariff deal with Japan US president says Japanese imports will face 15% levy instead of threatened 25%, prompting reports of a similar deal with the EU Financial markets around the world have rallied after Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Japan and speculation that a similar deal would soon be reached with the European Union. Share prices rose sharply in Tokyo, where the Nikkei inde of leading Japanese companies increased by 3.5%. European markets followed, with the FTSE 100 gaining 0.4% to close at a fresh record high of 9,061. US markets posted further gains with the Dow Jones rising by over 1% and the S&P closing up 0.78% at a record high. Markets were boosted by reports that the EU and US were closing in on a deal similar to the one the US struck with Japan , a 15% tariff on European imports. The EU is weighing €100bn (£87bn, $118bn) worth of tariffs on US imports if Trump does not agree a trade deal by the end of next week. Shares in Japanese carmakers rallied sharply. Shares in Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, surged by more than 14% and there were gains for Honda, Mazda and Subaru. London-based companies with the highest e posures to US tariffs – including GSK, AstraZeneca and Diageo – were among the biggest risers on the FTSE 100. A line graph showing movement in the FTSE 100 since January 2025 Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “News of a trade agreement between the US and Japan is fostering optimism among investors that further deals might be reached before punishing tariffs come into force.” Under the deal announced by the US president late on Tuesday , Japanese imports to the US will incur a 15% tariff, compared with the 25% level Trump had threatened to impose from 1 August. The levy, paid by US importers, remains above the 10% “baseline” global tariff that had been imposed by Washington while the two countries negotiated. The Japanese car industry, which accounts for 8% of jobs in the country, had been reeling from the threat of a 25% tariff on shipments to the US market. Vehicles and automotive parts account for more than a quarter of all Japanese e ports to the US. Trump claimed that the deal would open the Japanese market to US products including cars, trucks, rice and certain agricultural products, many of which had proved to be a sticking point in negotiations. The deal with Japan followed an agreement with the UK in May , as the first major country to reach a deal with the White House, which included limiting an increase in US tariffs on most British goods to 10%. Financial markets were thrown into a tailspin on 2 April by Trump’s “ liberation day ” tariff announcement, when he unveiled blanket levies of 10% and higher individual rates of up to 50% on dozens of markets, including those of economic allies and rivals alike. Trump paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days to allow for negotiations with trading partners after a dramatic sell-off in the US bond market. The markets staged a recovery, as investors bet that Washington would ultimately back down from the toughest measures. Trade between US and Japan Investors latched on the president’s reluctance to see through e treme threats by betting that “Trump always chickens out”, or Taco for short, in a Wall Street ma im influencing trading decisions. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Economists said the deal with Japan, which is the world’s fourth-largest economy and is the US’s fourth-largest import market, could be a prelude to further progress in negotiations with other big trading partners, including the EU. Shares in EU carmakers rallied on Wednesday, with Volkswagen up by more than 5% as traders bet the US-Japan deal could be a blueprint for an agreement between Washington and Brussels. Trump has set a deadline of 1 August for reaching a deal with the EU and other trading partners. Washington struck a deal with the Philippines on Tuesday, while the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has said talks would resume with China next week, ahead of the 12 August deadline Trump has set for a tariff agreement with the world’s second-largest economy. However, investors warned that the tariff rates on US imports were higher under the deals than they were before Trump entered the White House, increasing inflationary pressures for American households and rattling global supply chains. “Why are the markets jubilant this morning? Because even a higher tariff is preferable to continued uncertainty,” said George Lagarias, chief economist at the financial services company Forvis Mazars. “But this is hardly a catalyst for long-term optimism. If the deal with Japan is the standard by which the negotiation with the EU will go, then investors and businesses should begin to price in a deterioration of the macroeconomic backdrop.” The Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, said the deal was “precisely the result of my consistent advocacy and strong lobbying of the US since I proposed ‘investment over tariffs’ to President Trump at our White House summit in February”. Ishiba denied reports that he planned to announce his resignation after his coalition lost its upper house majority this week.

Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA Help wanted: Reeves seeks heavyweight economic advisers as budget looms Chancellor under pressure to recruit new experts as John Van Reenen and Anna Valero return to academia In the run-up to her crunch autumn budget, Rachel Reeves will seek to recruit a heavyweight economic adviser after the role of John Van Reenen is reduced. Van Reenen, a well-respected professor from the London School of Economics (LSE) and an e pert in productivity, has been chief economic adviser to the chancellor since Labour came to power. His role will be cut from three days to one a week as he returns to the LSE at the start of the academic year. Anna Valero, another member of Reeves’s council of economic advisers, will also depart. ‘He’s one of the best’: the economist shaping Rachel Reeves’s growth plans Read more Treasury sources said that while Van Reenen’s position was in theory part-time, his position at the chancellor’s side through a tumultuous 12 months had meant working “seven days a week”. Reeves is under intense pressure to respond to a deteriorating economic outlook with a fresh round of ta rises in her autumn budget. The chancellor has had a bruising few months after being forced to reverse her decision to remove the winter fuel allowance from most pensioners and take much of the blame from Labour’s backbenchers for the botched £5bn in cuts to disability benefits. At a House of Lords committee on Tuesday, the chancellor placed Van Reenen’s key insight – the need for higher investment to boost the UK’s productivity – at the heart of her economic strategy. The chancellor told peers: “The key problem is productivity and investment is the answer. Investment in human capital, investment in physical capital and also investment in new technologies. That’s why the fiscal rules I set out do treat investment differently.” She declined to rule out ta ing wealth more heavily, telling Lord Lamont, a former Conservative chancellor in the 1990s: “This is, with respect, what you would have done and did do in my position: you rightly said that ta is a matter for a budget and we’ll set out our policy then.” Treasury sources said Valero, also an LSE fellow, had always been e pected to return to academia but would remain in touch with government, adding that Valero and Van Reenen had worked on key policy announcements, including the industrial strategy and the spending review, which had now been completed. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion A Treasury spokesperson said: “John and Anna have provided invaluable leadership to the chancellor and will continue to do so in their new capacities.” Whitehall insiders said as lead adviser on industrial strategy, Valero’s departure risked leaving the policy without a powerful champion in the Treasury, which could make it tougher for departments tasked with grabbing the chancellor’s ear to ensure the policy was implemented effectively. Meanwhile, some Labour veterans have long warned that Reeves lacks a powerful enforcer who can impose the Treasury’s will across Whitehall, pointing to the role played by Ed Balls when Gordon Brown was chancellor, and to that of Rupert Harrison, George Osborne’s chief economic adviser. Van Reenen’s departure comes as Keir Starmer is beefing up his own economic e pertise.

A panel of five justices at the UK Supreme Court has ruled that Hayes’s conviction was unsafe, ending a decade-long battle. Hayes , who worked for UBS and Citigroup , served five-and-a-half years in prison for rigging Libor, a benchmark interest rate once used in the financial markets to underpin more than $350tn of loans and securities. The court of appeal last year upheld the guilty verdict, saying there was “indisputable documentary evidence” that he had sought to move Libor. But in 2022, a US court dismissed a criminal indictment against Hayes . Libor was used to set the borrowing cost on contracts with notional values of hundreds of trillions of pounds. Regulators found evidence that traders on a committee setting the rate every day had fi ed it for their own benefit. Banks paid fines worth hundreds of millions of pounds .

A panel of five justices, led by Lord Reed, concluded on Wednesday that the judge in Hayes’s original hearing 10 years ago had given “inaccurate and unfair” instructions to the jury that found him guilty on several charges of conspiracy to defraud. This meant the former banker was ultimately “deprived” of a fair trial. The judges stopped short of fully e onerating Hayes, saying there was “ample evidence” that could have led a jury, if properly directed, to find him guilty. “But the jury was not properly directed,” the ruling e plained, adding: “The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.” The court also quashed the conviction of the former Barclays trader Carlo Palombo, who was sentenced to four years in prison in 2019 for rigging Euribor – the euro version of Libor . It stated that Palombo’s original case was also compromised as a result of directions by the judge. Palombo told reporters that the case had been a ‘Kafkaesque nightmare’ . Lawyers for the pair suggested there could now be a path for other convictions to be challenged. City trader Tom Hayes’s conviction for Libor rigging is overturned Read more Financial markets around the world have rallied after Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Japan to minimise the level of tariffs imposed on Japanese goods imported into the US. Share prices rose sharply in Tokyo, where the Nikkei inde of leading Japanese companies increased by 3.5%. European markets followed, with the FTSE 100 gaining 0.5% to hit a record high of 9080 points in London. Shares in Japanese carmakers rallied sharply. Shares in Toyota , the world’s biggest carmaker, surged by more than 14% and there were gains for Honda , Mazda and Subaru . London-based companies with the highest e posures to US tariffs – including GSK, AstraZeneca and Diageo – were among the biggest risers on the FTSE 100. Markets rally after Trump announces tariff deal with Japan Read more The EU has threatened to impose nearly €100bn (£87bn) worth of tariffs on US imports ranging from bourbon whiskey and Boeing aircraft in one fell swoop if Donald Trump does not agree a trade deal by the end of next week. The European Commission said on Wednesday it now planned to combine two previously prepared separate lists of US goods to be included in any retaliatory moves against the US president’s import tariffs. If Brussels follows through on the threat, it would mean tariffs on US imports to the EU including poultry and alcohol in the first €21bn list, as well as the more recent list of €72bn of goods, which featured cars and planes. EU prepares €100bn no-deal plan to match Trump’s threat of 30% tariffs Read more 2d ago 16.32 CEST Jasper Jolly In the defence world, the UK is due to manufacture dozens of Typhoon fighter jets for Turkey, after Germany dropped opposition to e ports on human rights grounds. Defence minister John Healey today signed a memorandum of understanding - a prelude to a formal deal - with his Turkish counterpart, Yaşar Güler, paving the way for the first order of British-made fighter jets since 2017. Analysts have said Turkey could order as many as 40 planes. Manufacturer BAE Systems last week said the UK could sell up to 100 planes between Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The Typhoon is made by the Eurofighter consortium, with manufacturing shared between the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain. The UK, led by dominant weapons manufacturer, BAE Systems , produces 37% of the parts, as well as assembling the final plane for the UK and allies who order the planes via the British government. BAE last week said it was confident of securing more orders . ‘There’s a bit of a queue forming’: how UK firms are enticing buyers for the next generation of fighter jets Read more The order, if confirmed in the coming months, will secure manufacturing at Warton, Lancashire, where unions had raised concerns about the future of the assembly line, which has ground to a halt after the last of the UK orders. While the e ports are likely to be welcomed by workers at the plant, it would mean the UK would have to turn a blind eye to concerns over the increasingly authoritarian actions of Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , whose main political rival was last week given a prison sentence . Germany’s opposition had been a key factor preventing the e port of Typhoons to Turkey and also to Saudi Arabia, after the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi allegedly on the orders of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman . Keir Starmer said the government was determined to secure the Turkish orders and that they would “keep us and our allies safer during these uncertain times”. He said: “The UK’s production of Typhoon fighter jets is an engine for economic growth - supporting the lives and livelihoods of thousands of British people right across the UK.” BAE Systems says it is ‘confident’ of receiving orders for Typhoon jets Read more 2d ago 16.05 CEST US existing home sales fall US home sales fell last month, new data shows, in a sign that America’s housing market may be cooling. E isting-home sales (ie, not new homes) decreased by 2.7% in June, according to the National Association of Realtors . The NAR reports there were month-on-month sales falls in the Northeast, Midwest, and South, while they rose modestly in the West. Year-over-year, sales fell in the Northeast and West, while rising in the Midwest and South. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun says: “Multiple years of undersupply are driving the record high home price. Home construction continues to lag population growth. This is holding back first-time home buyers from entering the market. More supply is needed to increase the share of first-time homebuyers in the coming years even though some markets appear to have a temporary oversupply at the moment.” 2d ago 15.34 CEST Wall Street rises after US-Japan trade deal agreed Over in New York, stocks have opened higher as investors welcome the US-Japan trade deal announced last night. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 0.55% in early trading, gaining 244 points to 44,746 points. The broader S&P 500 share inde has risen by 0.35%, with the tech-focused Nasdaq inde up 0.3%. That’s a gentler reaction than in Tokyo, where the Nikkei inde surged by 3.5% today. Michał Jóźwiak, market analyst at global financial services firm Ebury , says: “News of the long-awaited US-Japan trade deal represents a milestone in the president’s trade jigsaw, reinforcing the perception that the White House is open to compromise. While the deal itself is not particularly surprising, the timing of the announcement is, as it comes a matter of only a few days after Prime Minister Ishiba’s coalition lost its majority in the upper house. The deal can be seen as a potential lifeline for Japan, as it represents a fairly significant concession from the Trump administration, while protecting the country’s vital automotive sector from harsher tariffs.” 2d ago 15.17 CEST Bessent: No rush to name Powell's successor Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has also suggested the White House isn’t in a rush to name America’s next top banker. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Bessent said: “I’m not going to talk about the process, but we are getting the process underway. “Obviously it’s going to be President Trump’s decision, and we’re not in a rush.” Pressure has been mounting on current Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell , with Trump attacking him for not cutting interest rates. Bessent suggested there were “a lot of strong candidates” to succeed Powell , including several people on the Fed’s main board, plus potentially regional bank presidents too. 2d ago 15.08 CEST EU prepares €100bn no-deal plan to match Trump’s threat of 30% tariffs Lisa O’Carroll The EU has threatened to impose nearly €100bn (£87bn) worth of tariffs on US imports ranging from bourbon whiskey and Boeing aircraft in one fell swoop if Donald Trump does not agree a trade deal by the end of next week.

Judgment has been handed down this morning in the matter of R (Respondent) v Hayes (Appellant); R (Respondent) v Palombo (Appellant) UKSC 2024/0087; UKSC 2024/0088: https://t.co/YyIIzhK8TM . pic. — UK Supreme Court  July 23, 2025 The key to the decision to overturn the convictions is that the judge hearing the case erred by telling the jury at the Hayes trial that if any consideration had been given to whether the rate submitted would be to the commercial advantage of the bank or a trader, then, as a matter of law, the rate submitted could not for that reason be a genuine or honest answer to the question posed by the LIBOR definition. 2d ago 14.33 CEST Back in the world of the trade war, US treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has e plained that Japan reached a trade deal with Donald Trump thanks to an innovative financing arrangement. Speaking to Bloomberg TV , Bessent e plained: “They got the 15% rate because they were willing to provide this innovative financing mechanism. “They came to us with the idea of a Japan-US partnership, where they are going to provide equity, credit guarantees and funding for major projects in the US.” Asked whether Brussels had come up with a similarly innovative idea, Bessent replied: “Not yet, but again, talks are going better than they had been.” 2d ago 14.02 CEST View image in fullscreen Former UBS and Citigroup trader Tom Hayes wearing a t-shirt with playing cards and that reads ''know when to hold 'em'', during his press conference after his and former Barclays trader Carlo Palombo today Photograph: Jaimi Joy/Reuters 2d ago 13.32 CEST The quashing of Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo’s convictions adds to the woes besetting the Serious Fraud Office, says Jonathan Fisher KC, Barrister at Red Lion Chambers. Fisher e plains: The Supreme Court makes clear that the failure in this case stemmed from judicial error - specifically, the misdirection of the jury by treating as a matter of law something that is actually a matter of fact - but this does not e onerate the SFO completely. The Supreme Court criticised the SFO for not making clear the precise nature of its case from the outset. This highlights just how challenging it is to prosecute financial market fraud cases in the criminal courts. This isn’t just an issue in the UK - only last week in the United States, former HSBC trader Mark Johnson had his fraud conviction overturned after a nine-year struggle. So today’s ruling is not in isolation - it reflects the broader reality that these cases are inherently comple and much careful thought needs to be given before a decision to prosecute is taken. The consequences of a failed prosecution can be devastating for the individual involved. In this case it is e tremely troubling that both defendants spent time in prison when, as the Supreme Court has now made clear, they shouldn’t have. 2d ago 13.31 CEST Today’s Supreme Court Judgment is “a personal triumph” for Tom Hayes and for Carlo Palombo, says Maia Cohen-Lask , partner at law firm Corker Binning . Cohen-Lask e plains: Both have long contended that they were unfairly scapegoated for behaviour that was not only endemic in the City in the early 2000s, but also in government during the banking crisis in 2008. “The judgment does not go so far as to e onerate them (indeed the judgment states that there was “ample evidence” on which a jury could have convicted). However, the judgment is a comprehensive vindication of the argument Hayes and Palombo have been making for many years: that if a LIBOR / EURIBOR submission was influenced by trading advantage, it could still be a genuine and honest answer to the question posed by the definition. “Despite calls for an investigation into the wider aspects of rate manipulation and the role of large banks in the early 2000s and the Treasury in 2008, it is unlikely that these calls will be heeded by those with the power to act. After all, LIBOR as a means of setting reference rates has been replaced and reforms to EURIBOR have radically altered its operation, so it could be argued that remediation has already occurred. In my view, the judgment will bring to an end a murky period without further light being cast through the lens of an independent inquiry.” 2d ago 13.27 CEST Today’s press conference heard criticism of the Serious Fraud Office’s role in the Libor convictions. Tom Hayes’s lawyer, Karen Todner , has e plained that today’s Supreme Court judgment is critical of the drafting of the indictment by the SFO and their team. She added: The prosecution of individuals by organisations other than the CPS - I include in this as well as the SFO, the Post Office and the RSPCA - should be removed. The only body who should be bringing criminal prosecutions in the United Kingdom are the Crown Prosecution Service. The dual role of the SFO as investigator and prosecutor creates a substantial conflict of interest which creates miscarriages of justice. 2d ago 13.06 CEST Apple and Google face more UK antitrust scrutiny Away from the Supreme Court ruling…. Britain’s competition regulator said it plans to designate Apple and Google with so-called strategic market status for their role in mobile ecosystems. The move comes as the CMA steps up its scrutiny of what it calls the two companies’ ‘duopoly’, Reuters reports . The plans announced today that a number of markets relating to mobile internet browsers were not working well for consumers or businesses. Apple’s Safari and Google’s Chrome dominate the mobile browser market on iPhones and Android devices, respectively. CMA head Sarah Cardell said in a statement: “Apple and Google’s mobile platforms are both critical to the UK economy ... but our investigation so far has identified opportunities for more innovation and choice. “The targeted and proportionate actions we have set out today would enable UK app developers to remain at the forefront of global innovation while ensuring UK consumers receive a world-class e perience.” A final decision on both the designations will be made by October 22, the statement said. The regulator also published roadmaps on potential further action as part of these parallel investigations. A strategic market status (SMS) designation allows the CMA to impose interventions on a firm, such as requiring it to adhere to specific behaviour so as not to undermine fair competition. Both Apple and Google pushed back against the CMA’s proposals, with Google calling the step “disappointing and unwarranted.” Google’s senior director for competition, Oliver Bethell , said. “It is ... crucial that any new regulation is evidence-based, proportionate and does not become a roadblock to growth in the UK.” Apple said separately it was concerned that the new rules being considered would undermine the privacy and security protections e pected by its users. 2d ago 13.02 CEST \"Path\" for other convictions to be overturned Lawyers representing Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo believe other traders who were convicted of rigging the Libor and Euribor interest rates could consider appealing their convictions too. Hayes’s lawyer, Karen Todner , tells reporters in London that she thinks they will all be taking advice over the course of the next couple of weeks to see if they can overturn their convictions. Ben Rose , who represented Palombo, says he takes a “slightly more strident” position, e plaining: My initial impression is that the ruling today opens the door to those seven securing a route by which they can have their convictions overturned. I can’t obviously promise that to them, but I think… I can see a path. 2d ago 12.55 CEST Here’s a photo from today’s press conference: View image in fullscreen Photograph: Kalyeena Makortoff E plore more on these topics Business Business live Economics Stock markets Tariffs Trump tariffs Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed",

Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPA UK borrowing rises more than e pected, putting pressure on Rachel Reeves June figure of £20.7bn comes as chancellor prepares for autumn budget where she may have to impose ta rises Analysis: Reeves faces gloomy autumn after borrowing overshoots The UK government borrowed more than e pected in June amid speculation the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will need to raise ta es at the autumn budget to repair the public finances. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed public sector net borrowing rose to £20.7bn, up by £6.6bn from the same month a year earlier, to reach the second-highest June borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993. City economists had forecast borrowing – the difference between public spending and income – to increase to £16.5bn. AstraZeneca unveils $50bn US investment as pharma tariff threat looms – business live Read more Reeves defended her fiscal rules on Tuesday, signalling she will take action in the autumn budget rather than risk breaking them, and refusing to rule out wealth ta es. “It is the fiscal rules that provide the stability that underpins a successful, thriving, prosperous economy and gives government bondholders the confidence to carry on buying those government bonds and we are still very reliant on the goodwill of strangers in buying our government bonds,” she said, giving evidence to the cross-party House of Lords economic affairs committee. “One in 10 pounds the government is spending is spent servicing government debt. “I’m a Labour politician. I don’t think there’s anything progressive about spending £100bn a year, often to US hedge funds, when I would rather spend that money on the health service or on our defence or on better schools for our children.” In June’s public finance data, the ONS said the escalating cost of providing public services and a large increase in servicing the government’s outstanding debts outstripped rising income from ta es and national insurance contributions. Interest charges on central government debt rose by £8.4bn to £16.4bn from a year earlier, the second-highest June level on records going back to 1997, driven by higher inde -linked gilt costs after a rise in the retail prices inde measure of inflation. It comes as Reeves prepares for a tough autumn budget amid mounting speculation over the need for large ta rises to cover a multibillion-pound shortfall in the public finances after the government’s high-stakes welfare U-turn earlier this month. Reeves acknowledged the U-turn had come at a price. “The OBR will do their costings in the autumn and set that out, probably to the tune of £5bn,” she said. UK borrowing chart Ministers have warned of “financial consequences” after the backtracking on disability benefits and winter fuel payments for pensioners. Alongside a sluggish economic outlook and possible downgrade in productivity forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the autumn budget, economists have said Reeves could face a £30bn shortfall against her fiscal rules. The UK economy shrank for two consecutive months in April and May, while unemployment and inflation have risen, as businesses and households come under pressure from ta rises, elevated borrowing costs and global uncertainty amid Donald Trump’s trade war. Despite the June overshoot in borrowing, the sum borrowed over the first three months of the financial year was close to the level predicted by the OBR at the March spring statement. However, economists said ta rises were increasingly likely amid rising borrowing levels. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion “We e pect ‘sin ta ’ and duty hikes, freezing income ta thresholds for an e tra year in 2029 and a pensions ta raid – reinstating the lifetime limit on pension pots and cutting relief – to fill most of the hole,” said Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. “The fiscal pain will, however, continue beyond the autumn. Defence spending will almost certainly have to rise faster than the government currently planned, for instance, necessitating further ta hikes or rule tweaks.” Reeves has faced growing demands from Labour backbenchers, unions and the former party leader Neil Kinnock to consider introducing a wealth ta . However, the chancellor has so far sought to keep her options open while pushing to reassure business leaders that her priority remains driving up economic growth. Challenged by the former Tory chancellor Norman Lamont on Tuesday to rule out a wealth ta , Reeves said: “This is, with respect, what you would have done, and did do, in my position: you rightly said that ta is a matter for a budget and we’ll set out our policy then.” The Institute for Fiscal Studies said on Monday there was a “strong case” for the chancellor to tweak her self-imposed rule, which requires day-to-day spending to be matched by receipts by the fifth year of official forecasts. Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said Labour was spending money it did not have. “Labour’s jobs ta and reckless borrowing is killing growth and fuelling inflation – paving the way for more ta hikes and more borrowing in the autumn,” he said. “Make no mistake – working families will pay the price for Labour’s failure and costly U-turns.” According to the latest snapshot, public sector net debt, the sum of every annual borrowing figure, was estimated at 96.3% of GDP, one of its highest levels since the 1960s. The OBR warned earlier this month that the UK’s public finances were on an unsustainable long-term trajectory , driven by rising debt levels, the growing cost of state pensions and the mounting climate emergency.

Reeves says we are living in an “age of insecurity”, and economic policy has to respond to that. She also points to her “challenging economic inheritance”, with high levels of ta as a share of GDP, historic high levels of government debt, and “very poor” economic growth over the last 15 years due to weak productivity growth. So the growth strategy has to address this. Reeves says the government’s growth strategy is about building “resilience and stability”. Stability means fiscal rules which the government sticks to – the pledge to fund day-to-day spending through ta receipts, and to have debt falling as a share of GDP while still delivering investment. Reeves says this stability has allowed the Bank of England to cut interest rates four times in the last year. We have faced challenges this first year. The international geopolitical backdrop is probably not one that any government would want, but that’s what we have. Despite that, Reeves insists that the government showed the “political courage and strength” to stick to those fiscal rules in the budget, in the spring statement and in the spending review. “We will continue to do so,” she pledges.

Reeves told the House of Lords economics affairs committee that the government showed the “political courage and strength” to stick to those fiscal rules, adding: “We will continue to do so.” Reeves also resisted an invitation to rule out a wealth ta in the autumn budget, and warned that the UK was still reliant on “the goodwill of strangers” willing to buy its debt, saying: “We are still very reliant on the goodwill of strangers in buying our government bonds. “I’m a Labour politician. I don’t think there’s anything progressive about spending 100 billion pounds a year, often to U.S. hedge funds, when I would rather spend that money on the health service or on defence or on better schools.” Reeves was speaking just hours after the latest UK public finances data showed a jump in borrowing last month. Public sector net borrowing rose to £20.7bn, up by £6.6bn from the same month a year earlier to reach the second-highest June borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993. UK borrowing rises more than e pected, putting pressure on Rachel Reeves Read more The UK’s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, pointed out that borrowing so far this financial year was in line with its forecasts. But, several economists still predicted that Reeves would raise ta es in the autumn, given the opposition from Labour MPs to spending cuts. Rachel Reeves faces gloomy autumn after borrowing overshoots Read more Reeves also urged businesses to hire unemployed and economically inactive members of the UK labour market , rather than relying on migration. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned the chancellor against watering down City banking rules, warning it risks repeating the mistakes that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Members of the Bank’s FPC told MPs that financial stability was crucial to achieving growth . Bailey also hinted that he might not support the introduction of a digital pound , if the Bank’s efforts to embed digital payments technologies into commercial bank payment systems succeeded.

Q: If you had the time to go into your local pub, they’d complain to you about the impact. Did the Treasury model the impact of the NICs changes? Rachel Reeves says the Labour government discovered a number of unfunded spending commitments when it entered office, so she decided to increase ta es on businesses and the wealthiest by £40bn in the budget. She says the government took steps to protect smaller firms from the NICS increase, such as increasing the Employment Allowance, which cut the cost of employing people on the minimum wage. She concede that the NICS increase has been painful for businesses. But the counterfactual, she insists, would either have been higher ta es on working people, cuts to public services, or higher borrowing. 3d ago 16.30 CEST Reeves declines to rule out wealth ta es Former chancellor Lord Lamont then asks the present chancellor if she will rule out a wealth ta , something which some Labour MPs are demanding. Q: Doesn’t the whiff of a wealth ta undermine confidence? Wouldn’t it be better to just rule it out? Rachel Reeves says the government made commitments before the last election about various ta es related to working people, such as income ta , national insurance and VAT. What is a wealth ta and would it work in the UK? Read more But she declines to speculate about ta changes, reminding Lamont that he took a similar view about future fiscal policy in his time at Number 11. She says: If you start saying no to other ta es, then as soon as you don’t say no people will assume that’s the one you’re going to increase. It is right, and with respect this is what you did in my position, you rightly said that ta es are a matter for a budget, and we’ll set out our policy there. Rachel Reeves, asked by Norman Lamont why she won't say no to a wealth ta : \"As soon as you don't say no, people will assume that that is the one you're going to raise\" — John Rentoul  July 22, 2025 Yesterday, The Times reported that Reeves was e pected to reject pressure from left-wing Labour MPs to implement a wealth ta , due to fears it would not raise any money because wealthy people would simply leave the UK. 3d ago 16.22 CEST Reeves then tells their Lordships that she wants to retilt the system so more young people can get an apprenticeship, or go to an FE college. The chancellor points out that those who don’t go to university are missing out, saying: At my school, where I went - quite a lot of years ago now - I was in the very small minority who went to university. The government carried on investing in my education for years, very e pensively. In contrast, many of the girls at Reeves’s school left at 16, or 18, despite being bright “because they didn’t have those aspirations” and didn’t get the same opportunities. 3d ago 16.16 CEST Q: How can we get the “British dream” going, to lift productivity? Rachel Reeves cites her reforms to savings, to encourage people to put their spare cash into investments, and to provide “long-term, patient capital” for the nation’s entrepreneurs. The chancellor also suggests part of the British dream is to own your own home – that’s why the government is aiming to raise housebuilding levels. 3d ago 16.12 CEST Reeves: Nothing progressive about UK's debt servicing bills Q: What are the fiscal consequences of the government’s u-turn on the welfare bill? Chancellor Rachel Reeves says the changes to the welfare bill will have a cost – probably around £5bn, but the Office for Budget Responsibility will do the calculations. She reiterates her commitment to the fiscal rules, e plaining: We are still very relient on the goodwill of strangers in buying our government bonds. One in every ten pounds of government spending is spent servicing government debt. Reeves says there’s nothing “progressive” about spending £100bn per year on debt servicing, which she says often goes to US hedge funds, rather than on health, defence, or schools. 3d ago 16.07 CEST Reeves: unforgiveable of Tories to make unfunded commitments Rachel Reeves then criticises the previous government of committing to delivering “lots of lots” of projects, without working out how to pay for them. She tells the House of Lords economic affairs committee: That is how you end up in politics with the levels of distrust of politicians and the democratic system. I do think it is unforgiveable to make a load of commitments without having a single clue about where the money was going to come from. I’m not going to do that. Thursday briefing: The £40bn funding gap, £22bn ‘black hole’ and more tricky terms, e plained Read more 3d ago 15.58 CEST Reeves adds that immigration will continue to play an important part in creating the UK’s \"skills mi ”, before repeating that “we can’t just turn to the immigration lever”. 3d ago 15.56 CEST Reeves says UK businessses shouldn't always reach for 'the immigration lever' to fill vacancies Chancellor Rachel Reeves is now urging businesses to hire workers from the ranks of the unemployed and economically inactive, rather than relying on migration. She is asked about demographics, with Lord Turnbull citing the “severe worsening” of the dependency ratio. This ratio compares the number of people in a population who are typically not in the workforce (ie, are dependent) with the number of people who are typically in the workforce. Turnbull points the finger of blame at the young, saying it can take people until their mid-20s to get into work today, rather than finding a job at 16. The birth rate is very low, creating a shortage of workers, leading to “very high levels” of net migration, he says. Q: How do you balance protecting the public finances and addressing the needs of the labour market against the social pressures this migration is causing? The chancellor tells the House of Lords economics committe that countries around the world face demographic challenges – the UK’s situation is not the worst by a long way, she says. She says the major independent commission on the pensions system launched yesterday will help address this. Britain is facing a ‘tsunami’ of pensioner poverty, says Kendall Read more Reeves then urges businesses not to turn to migration to fill vacancies. She says there are “a lot of people here in Britain who are not working”, citing that 20% of people of working age are classed as economically inactive, and an unemployment rate of over 4%. I do not think that businesses should always resort to the immigration lever to fill vacancies. We need to do a lot more to train up people who are already in this country. ONS data last week showed there were 736,000 vacancies in March to May. Reeves says: There are plenty of people of working age in this economy, with the right support they should be able to work. 3d ago 15.34 CEST The Lords turn to ta . Q: Since the war, no government until now managed to bring in more than 35% of GDP in ta ation. It’s now around 37.5% – what level do you think is sustainable? Reeves says the Office for Budget Responsibility (the fiscal watchdog) forecasts ta will hit 38% of GDP at the end of the parliament – that’s not a target though! Increasing GDP is the best way to reduce that ratio without cutting investment in public services, she says. 3d ago 15.30 CEST Rachel Reeves is then asked why the UK economy is suffering from slugging growth, rising unemployment, stubborn inflation. Q: What’s your diagnosis of the ills of the UK economy? The key problem is productivity, and investment is the answer, the chancellor replies. 3d ago 15.22 CEST Reeves adds that trade policy is another important area of reform. She cites the UK becoming the first country to reach a trade deal with the US, plus the “reset” with the European Union and a trade deal with India. 3d ago 15.17 CEST Rachel Reeves then cites the government’s changes to the planning system, which are currently being considered by the House of Lords. She urges the Lords to pass the planning and infrastructure bill quickly, so that the UK can get on with “getting things done”, such as transport and energy infrastructure, or new data centres. The chancellor also points to her pensions review, and yesterday’s review of the water sector, as areas where the government are pushing reforms through. 3d ago 15.15 CEST Reeves: We'll stick to fiscal rules despite geopolitical challenges The House of Lords economic affairs committee begins with Lord Wood asking chancellor Rachel Reeves about her growth plans: Q: What is your strategy to achieve growth, without borrowing more than your fiscal rules allow or by boosting current spending more than your ta commitments allow? Reeves says we are living in an “age of insecurity”, and economic policy has to respond to that.

Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock Analysis Rachel Reeves faces gloomy autumn after borrowing overshoots Heather Stewart Economics editor Very tough budget looms as interest rate costs on bonds drive June figure to second-highest on record UK borrowing rises more than e pected Business live – latest updates June’s public finances data, published on Tuesday, make a depressing end-of-term report card for Rachel Reeves , as MPs prepare to depart Westminster for the summer recess. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said public borrowing jumped to £20.7bn last month – a full £3.5bn higher than e pected by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). That made it the second-highest figure for any June on record, aside from in the Covid-hit year of 2020, when the government was paying millions of workers’ salaries through the furlough scheme. UK borrowing rises more than e pected, putting pressure on Rachel Reeves Read more The current deficit for the month, which Reeves watches closely, as her key fiscal rule aims to eliminate it in five years’ time, was £16.3bn – £7.1bn more than the equivalent month in 2024. The overshoot appears to have been driven not so much by a spendthrift Labour Treasury, but by higher-than-e pected interest costs for government bonds , or gilts, some of which rise automatically with inflation, as measured by the traditional retail prices inde (RPI). Inflation has been climbing in recent months, hitting 4.4% on the RPI measure. The Treasury paid £16.4bn in interest on gilts in June, the ONS said – almost twice the £8.4bn of the same month a year ago, and £2.4bn more than the OBR e pected. UK borrowing chart The news doesn’t look nearly so bad when the first three months of the new financial year are taken as a whole, however – the ONS says the £57.8bn of borrowing over this period is in line with what the OBR forecast in March. That suggests, at least, that the watchdog need not start its autumn budget forecast from a baseline that has already drifted way out of line with its March expectations. But the worse-than-e pected June figure underlines how delicate the chancellor’s situation remains, with headroom of just £9.9bn at the end of the five-year forecast period, according to the OBR – some of which has already been eaten up by the reversal of the £5bn disability benefits cuts, and the £1.25bn cost of restoring the winter fuel allowance to most pensioners. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Potentially much larger than that is the impact of the OBR’s summer forecast “stocktake”, which will revisit its economic modelling and could result in significant revisions, perhaps of £10bn or even £20bn according to some forecasters, which Reeves will then have to contend with in the autumn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested a shift to Reeves’s framework on Monday that would free her from the need to adjust policy in spring statements, in response to relatively small swings in forecasts. The chancellor’s team are considering the role of the OBR forecasts, and this kind of change could help to avoid a repeat of the hasty target-driven policymaking that ultimately led to the welfare U-turn. But none of it appears likely to rescue the chancellor in time for what looks likely to be a very tough budget in the autumn – made no easier at all by the worse-than-e pected state of the public finances for June.

Ministers are promising the “biggest overhaul of water since privatisation”, as they pledge to take on one of Sir Jon Cunliffe’s 88 recommendations to fi the sector . Ofwat will be replaced by a “new, single, powerful regulator”, which will also take on water-related responsibilities of the Environment Agency , Natural England and the Drinking Water Inspectorate ( as recommended by Cunliffe’s Independent Water Commission at 6am this morning ). Secretary of State for the Environment, Steve Reed , says this move will end the “comple ity” that is hurting customers. In a speech at Kingfisher Wharf now, Reed is pledging to strengthen regulation, clean up the country’s rivers and protect the public from soaring water bills. Reed says: “Our water industry is broken. That is why this Government will fi our broken regulatory system so the failures of the past never happen again. “The Government will abolish Ofwat. In the biggest overhaul of water regulation in a generation, we will bring water functions from four different regulators into one. “A single, powerful regulator responsible for the entire water sector will stand firmly on the side of customers, investors and the environment and prevent the abuses of the past.” “It will provide the clarity and direction required for a strong partnership between Government, the sector and investors to attract billions of pounds of new investment.” Key events 4d ago Government to take on five recommendations straight away 4d ago Closing post 4d ago Seven key takeways from the Water industry report 4d ago Record highs on Wall Street 4d ago IFS urges Reeves to tweak fiscal rules margin 4d ago Green Party: Public ownership only way to clean up water sector 4d ago Cunliffe: Civil servants could lose jobs under regulatory shake-up 4d ago UK rules prevent special treatment for Thames Water, minister says 4d ago Ofwat: We will help ensure a smooth transition to new regulator 4d ago Reed: children shouldn't have to worry about to ic sewage pollution once we've cleaned the sector up 4d ago Replacing Ofwat could take two years, Cunliffe tells the Guardian 4d ago Government: Ofwat to be abolished in biggest overhaul of water since privatisation 4d ago Cunliffe: Ofwat's econometric approach has gone before limits of effectiveness 4d ago Cunliffe: current regulators will not achieve what is needed 4d ago Cunliffe: water industry has not met public expectations 4d ago Cunliffe: the UK is facing another “Great Stink Moment” 4d ago Full story: New ‘powerful water regulator to replace failed Ofwat’ in drive to reset sector 4d ago The key recommendations in the water sector review 4d ago Accelerated rollout of compulsory smart water meters recommended 4d ago New 'regulatory forbearance' could allow water companies to dodge fines 4d ago Campaigner Feargal Sharkey: Steve Reed should resign over 'utter shambles' 4d ago Surfers Against Sewage: this is putting lipstick on a pig 4d ago Report criticises Ofwat's 'desk-based' approach to regulation 4d ago GMB: It's time to renationalise water 4d ago Public ownership of water left UK 'dirty man of Europe', says Sir Jon Cunliffe 4d ago Commission recommends 'new mandatory Water Ombudsman' to handle complaints 4d ago Concerns raised about profit motive of privately owned water customers 4d ago Commission recommends new integrated water regulators to replace Ofwat 4d ago Introduction: Independent Water Commission pushes for 'fundamental reform' Show key events only Please turn on JavaScript to use this feature 4d ago 18.45 CEST Government to take on five recommendations straight away Helena Horton And finally… over in parliament, environment secretary Steve Reed has told MPs he will be immediately taking forward five of Sir Jon’s recommendations.

Reed said: “The lack of water infrastructure that held back Cambridge and O ford for so long will not happen again.” Finally, Reed committed to giving strong ministerial directives to the EA and Ofwat- while it still e ists and said these will “set out our expectations and requirements”. Cunliffe had recommended ministers showed more leadership to the regulator and ended a “light touch” approach. Asked by Clive Lewis , Labour MP for Norwich South, why the report did not consider nationalisation, he said: “we have to take a rational and not an ideological approach” and said Defra had independently calculated that nationalising the water industry would cost £100bn. 4d ago 17.00 CEST Closing post Time for a recap… A new water regulator will replace the powers of Ofwat, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency to “reset” a sector tarnished by scandals over sewage spills and financial mismanagement, after a major review of the sector. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, said: “The government will abolish Ofwat. In the biggest overhaul of water regulation in a generation, we will bring water functions from four different regulators into one. “A single, powerful regulator responsible for the entire water sector will stand firmly on the side of customers, investors and the environment and prevent the abuses of the past.” The creation of a new regulator was one of 88 recommendations made by Sir Jon Cunliffe in his review of the England and Wales water industry . Cunliffe warned: This sector requires fundamental reform on all sides – how we manage the demands on water, how the system is regulated, how companies are governed and how we manage the critical infrastructure on which we all rely. Speaking to reporters this morning, Cunliffe compared the current situation to the Great Stink of 1858. Cunliffe also suggested that it could take two years to set up the replacement for Ofwat, and suggested some civil servants could lose their jobs under the shake-up . But, there was disappointment in some quarters that the Independent Water Commission was not allowed to give full consideration to the hypothetical renationalisation of the sector. As Unite general secretary Sharon Graham puts it: “Water workers and the public will just think this report is a bad joke - it doesn’t even consider returning water to public ownership. “If the government thinks a new regulator will solve the problems of privatisation they will be badly disappointed. The public’s bills are due to rise by a third over the next five years, we are e periencing hosepipe bans, seeing rivers clogged with sewage and CEOs making millions for overseas shareholders. “Our collapsing water system is a mark of shame for this country and any sensible government would be taking steps to nationalise Thames Water and all the other failed companies.” Here’s the full story: Ofwat to be abolished in ‘reset’ of water industry regulation Read more And here’s our key takeaways from the report: Water review in England and Wales: seven key takeways Read more 4d ago 16.54 CEST The Prospect union are warning that the upcoming water regulatory regime must give the industry’s workforce “the power and investment” to do their jobs properly. Steve Thomas, Prospect deputy general secretary, said of today’s Cunliffe Review : “This is an important and timely review, following years of underinvestment in the water sector and its regulators. “It is essential that the specialist workforce of the new single regulator is given the requisite power and investment to do its job effectively, whilst ensuring that environmental regulation remains robust and is not diluted. “Recommendations around strengthening the regulator’s ability to recruit and retain the right staff through greater pay fle ibility would be a welcome first step in achieving this. “The Government must also ensure that any decisions regarding the abolition and merging of arms-length bodies in this space is done through meaningful engagement with trade unions and the specialist workers in the sector and does not come at the e pense of the vital work carried out by existing environmental regulators.” 4d ago 16.48 CEST Seven key takeways from the Water industry report Here’s our breakdown of the key recommendations in Sir Jon Cunliffe’s review of the water industry: Water review in England and Wales: seven key takeways Read more 4d ago 16.35 CEST Professor Hannah Cloke, Professor of Hydrology at the University of Reading , warns the water industry against wasting years creating new structures to tackle its problems…. “Water industry reforms are long overdue and badly needed. A single regulator instead of multiple overlapping bodies makes perfect sense, as does giving local areas more say in water planning. But we can’t spend years setting up new structures while our rivers stay polluted and reservoirs run dry. The real challenge isn’t designing better systems on paper – it’s getting companies to actually fi leaking pipes, stop dumping sewage, and build the infrastructure we need. Less reorganising, more doing.” 4d ago 16.10 CEST Record highs on Wall Street View image in fullscreen Photograph: Seth Wenig/AP Back in the financial markets, US stocks have hit a new record high. Both the S &P 500 shares inde , and the tech-focused Nasdaq , have hit new intraday peaks in early trading on Wall Street. That e tends the rally that began when Donald Trump delayed his new tariffs in mid-April. David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation , says the Trump trade war is still a big issue for the markets, along with company results as Alphabet and Tesla are both due to report this week. With the earnings season picking up several gears and trade tensions heating up again, markets look poised for a week of headline-driven swings, especially as investors look to tech giants for reassurance on sales and earnings. Trade tensions remain a central theme as the countdown to the 1st of August tariff deadline proceeds. On Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reinforced the administration’s firm stance, insisting that the 1st of August was the “hard deadline” for countries to begin paying tariffs. He did, however, leave the door open for post-deadline negotiations, saying, “Nothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1st.” Markets have taken note. With talks ongoing and few signs of any last-minute breakthroughs, investors remain wary of further escalation. The clarity from Mr Lutnick suggests that the administration intends to follow through this time, meaning the clock is now ticking for key trading partners to strike deals or face penalties. 4d ago 15.44 CEST View image in fullscreen The dry bed of a section of the Rochdale Canal, after the prolonged dry spell caused water levels continue to fall across the whole canal network in Manchester.

In a short policy note published on Monday, the IFS said fiscal policy is in a “bad equilibrium,” with spending policies hurriedly adjusted in response to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s twice-yearly forecasts. The IFS rejects the idea the OBR should only produce one forecast a year, as some commentators have suggested. Instead, it says Reeves should implement plans to give herself a 0.5% margin next Spring, instead of in 2027 as planned. It says: “This is an elegant and sensible solution to the tension between having a single fiscal event but two forecasts each year. If at the second forecast the government is slightly on the wrong side of where it wants to be, no immediate action is required. If it’s a long way on the wrong side, with a current budget deficit of more than 0.5% of GDP, then the Chancellor does need to respond.” However, the IFS said this e tra cushion should only apply at Spring statements - allowing the chancellor time to think about how to respond to modest forecast changes - and not at budgets in the autumn, in case a deficit of 0.5% risks effectively becoming the new target. 4d ago 15.02 CEST The opposition Conservative party “cautiously welcomed” Sir Jon Cunliffe’s report into the water industry this morning. Shadow environment minister Robbie Moore told Sky News that there was a ‘huge amount of detail’ in the report, including 88 recommendations such as creating a new water regulator. Moore says there needs to be reassurance for investors, satisfaction for bill payers, and higher water quality. Moore adds that the Conservatives ( who bear a lot of responsibility for the state of the water industry ) did give regulators tougher enforcement powers to increase water company monitoring when they were in government. Q: Do you agree that Ofwat has failed? There have been failures within the regulatory system, Moore agrees. 'There have been failures within the [water] regulatory system, ' shadow environment minister Robbie Moore MP tells @WilfredFrost He says the Conservatives 'cautiously welcome' the water industry review. https://t.co/ub6Li2Qzs6 📺 Sky 501 pic. — Sky News  July 21, 2025 4d ago 14.43 CEST Water company shares has pushed higher during today’s trading. Pennon Group (owner of South West Water, Bournemouth Water and Bristol Water) is now up almost 1.5%. Severn Trent has gained 0.5% while United Utilities is up 0.6%. This is partly because analysts at Bernstein have lifted their price targets for all three companies this morning, saying “We remain constructive on UK water utilities”. Bernstein added: Alongside the new regulatory period, the sector is also entering a structural growth super-cycle. That is a reference to AMP8 (Asset Management Plan 8) the five-year regulatory period for the UK water industry which started in April.

Photograph: Valéry Hache/AFP/Getty Images Two days less holiday? France is up in arms but my sympathy is limited Paul Taylor This small cutback is hardly a draconian austerity purge for a country that is broke. But the howls of outrage show a rational debate is unlikely F rance is skint, but the French are in denial. To judge by the howls of outrage from the left and the hard right of the French political spectrum, you would think the prime minister, François Bayrou, had just taken a Javier Milei-style chainsaw to public services, announced Doge-style mass layoffs or imposed swingeing pay cuts. But it was Bayrou’s suggestion that the French should give up two of their 11 cherished public holidays – Easter Monday and 8 May, the anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe – and work instead to increase economic output and hence government revenue that provoked the anger. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, accused the centrist prime minister of leading a “race towards an economic, financial and social abyss for the greater suffering of all”. The Socialist party leader, Olivier Faure, described the proposals as “a demolition plan for our French model”, and Jordan Bardella, president of the hard-right National Rally (RN), said the the proposal to cancel the two holidays was “a direct attack on our history”. The hard left and the populist right threatened to bring down the government with no confidence motions in the autumn, when the budget will be put to a hung parliament, as they did with Bayrou’s short-lived predecessor, Michel Barnier, last year. As is so often the case, the sound and fury in the echo chamber of French political rhetoric is out of all proportion to reality. Bayrou proposes a standstill in public sector pay, pensions, welfare benefits and ta thresholds in 2026, which, with inflation forecast to increase slightly to about 1.4% next year, means a modest erosion of living standards for most people and a slightly increased ta take. Better-off pensioners will pay more ta , poorer ones will pay less. The measures are supposed to reduce the deficit by €43.8bn to 4.6% of economic output next year. Only defence spending will be increased, in line with France’s commitment to Nato, given Europe’s deteriorating security situation. This is hardly a draconian austerity purge for a country that had a deficit of 5.8% of GDP last year – the highest in the euro area – and which by most rational measurements is living beyond its means. National debt has risen to 113% of GDP , higher than any EU country e cept Greece and Italy. But while their debt piles are falling, France’s keeps on growing. Public spending accounts for 56.5% of GDP in France, the second highest level in the EU after Finland. Despite the centrist president Emmanuel Macron’s intention to reduce the ta burden and get more French people into work when he took office in 2017, a series of crises – the revolt of the gilets jaunes against a carbon ta , the Covid-19 pandemic and the effects of Russia’s war in Ukraine – triggered more state e penditure. In 2023, France’s ta -to-GDP ratio was 43.8%, significantly higher than the average of 33.9% in advanced economies . The country has too many layers of public administration, which together employ 5.8 million people – 20% of the total workforce. Bayrou proposed that one in three retiring civil servants should not be replaced, drawing immediate protests from trade unions representing teachers, health workers and the police. Perhaps the most telling criticism came from Édouard Philippe, Macron’s first prime minister and a likely centrist presidential candidate, who said Bayrou’s package contained no structural reforms of failing public policies and was just an emergency plan to limit the damage without solving the problem. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion View image in fullscreen French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou presents the 2026 budget outlining plans to scrap two public holidays Photograph: Stefano Lorusso/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock A ing a couple of public holidays would go some way towards narrowing the gap between the number of hours worked per inhabitant in France compared with competitors such as Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK – not to mention the United States or South Korea. But the French are militantly resistant to any attempt to remove acquired social rights, regardless of the economic situation, changing demography or dire public finances, as they showed with sustained social unrest over Macron’s raising of the retirement age to 64. It’s not that French workers actually work much less than their European counterparts. But France has less of its population in employment because of a combination of earlier retirement, later entry into the labour market, higher unemployment and welfare dependency. “The markets and the EU are watching us,” Pierre Moscovici, the president of the French court of accounts and a former finance minister and European commissioner, said after presenting an annual report that warned that the country’s debt was approaching a tipping point. “As demanding and difficult as it may be, getting our public finances under control from 2026 is imperative for debt sustainability,” he added. France has long enjoyed the indulgence of bond market vigilantes because of its ability to raise revenue and a presumption that its debt was implicitly backed by Germany, since a French financial crisis would trigger severe turbulence in the eurozone. But several credit ratings agencies have recently lowered France’s sovereign rating because of a concern that the government will be unable to enact serious deficit-cutting measures without a parliamentary majority. French people need to get real about their fiscal predicament before it descends into an acute crisis. So far there is little sign of that reality dawning on either the political class or the population. The left just keeps repeating that the government should soak the rich and reimpose a wealth ta , even though that would make little more than a symbolic dent in the deficit. The populist right argues that the state could save all the money it needs if only it stopped paying benefits to immigrants. Those numbers don’t add up either. With so many politicians encouraging voters to go on believing that “public money” grows on trees or can be borrowed in unlimited amounts – Mélenchon has argued in the past that France should default on its debt – it is hard to have a rational debate on the budget. The stage is set for another battle of wills in parliament, and probably in the street. If the uneasy grouping of centrist and conservative parties supporting Bayrou cannot get something resembling his proposed savings through the National Assembly this autumn, France may be plunged into a real financial crisis that could play into the hands of Marine Le Pen’s National Rally ahead of the next presidential election, due in 2027.

Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters Superbugs could kill millions more and cost $2tn a year by 2050, models show E clusive: Research on burden of antibiotic resistance for 122 countries predicts dire economic and health outcomes Superbugs could cause millions more people to die worldwide and cost the global economy just under $2tn a year by 2050, modelling shows. A UK government-funded study shows that without concerted action, increased rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could lead to global annual GDP losses of $1.7tn over the next quarter of a century. The research, by the Center for Global Development thinktank, found the US, UK and EU economies would be among the hardest hit, prompting accusations that recent swingeing aid cuts are self-defeating. On Thursday, the UK government announced it was a ing funding for the Fleming fund , which combats AMR in low- and middle-income countries, as part of wider aid cuts . The Trump administration has confirmed $9bn in cuts to its foreign aid budget, while a number of European countries have also reduced spending on overseas aid. Anthony McDonnell, the lead author of the research and a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, said: “When we conducted our research on the economic impacts of antimicrobial resistance, it was anticipated that resistance rates would continue to follow historical trends. “However, the sudden cuts to Official Development Assistance by the US, which has cut its aid spend by roughly 80%; the UK, which has announced aid cuts from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income; and substantial reductions by France, Germany, and others, could drive up resistance rates in line with the most pessimistic scenario in our research. “Even countries that have been successful in keeping AMR rates under control cannot afford to be complacent. Unless AMR programmes are protected from aid cuts, resistance rates across the world will likely increase at a rate in line with the worst-affected countries. “This would result in millions more people dying worldwide, including across G7 nations. Investing in treatment for bacterial infections now will save lives and deliver billions in long-term economic returns.” The research calculated the economic and health burden of antibiotic resistance for 122 countries and forecast that in that in this most pessimistic scenario, by 2050, GDP losses in China could reach just under $722bn a year, the US $295.7bn, the EU $187bn, Japan $65.7bn and the UK $58.6bn. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), deaths from AMR are e pected to increase 60% by 2050, with 1.34 million people in the US and 184,000 in the UK alone predicted to die each year from antibiotic resistant bugs, while numbers of those becoming seriously ill from drug-resistant bacteria are also e pected to jump. Superbugs increase the number of hospital admissions and lead to longer and more intensive hospital stays, costlier second-line treatments and more comple care, meaning resistant infections are roughly twice as e pensive to treat as those for which antibiotics are effective. The study estimates global health costs of treating AMR could increase by just under $176bn a year, while in the UK, they would rise from $900m to $3.7bn and in the US from $15.5bn to just under $57bn. Higher rates of resistant bugs would also shrink the UK, EU and US workforces by 0.8%, 0.6% and 0.4% respectively, the study found. But if countries invest more in tackling superbugs – increasing access to new antibiotics and high-quality treatment of these infections – the US economy would grow $156.2bn a year and the UK $12bn (£9.3bn) by 2050. Responding to the findings, Dr Mohsen Naghavi, a professor of health metrics at IHME, said: “Today the threat of AMR is increasing, and without immediate action from all stakeholders the medicines we have access to now could stop working, potentially causing a simple infection to become deadly.” That would involve policy changes from the US, European and UK governments, the development of new drugs and ensuring everyone understood that antibiotics were ineffective against viruses, he added. A UK government spokesperson said: “Our 10-year health plan recognises antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a major threat and commits to urgently tackle its spread, including through new vaccines. “We have made important progress - reducing antibiotic use in meat and pioneering a world-first subscription model to incentivise the development of new treatments. We also continue to work closely with international partners to influence global efforts to limit the spread of AMR.” E plore more on these topics Antibiotics Microbiology Global economy Foreign policy Aid Health Health policy news Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed",

Photograph: Isabel Infantes/Reuters The quiet, matter-of-fact takeover of women holding senior economist roles Heather Stewart From Rachel Reeves to the MPC, and thinktanks to unions and lobby groups, many of the authoritative voices we hear discussing economics are female Rachel Reeves is rightly proud of being the first female chancellor of the e chequer, but she is far from alone: the commanding heights of economic policymaking in the UK are becoming much less male. At a Westminster thinktank event last week about whether Labour is still a “mission-led government”, one of the most striking things was not the panel’s answer, which you can probably guess, but the fact that it was made up of three women, and one token man. The Institute for Government’s director, Hannah White, was joined by its chief economist, Gemma Tetlow, and the no-nonsense new director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Helen Miller – as well as Stephen Bush of the Financial Times. Elsewhere, the Resolution Foundation is now run by Ruth Curtice, a former Treasury economist. Rain Newton-Smith, another economist, has the task of repairing the CBI’s scandal-rocked reputation as its director general. Two of the four deputy governors of the Bank of England are women, too – as are the leaders of a string of powerful trades unions. This female takeover has been a quiet and matter-of-fact one – but it marks a significant change, very noticeable upon returning to covering the field, after a few years away. It has not yet been reflected in the gender balance of students picking economics at GCSE, A-level or as a degree, unfortunately. Research commissioned by the Bank of England showed this year that economics classes at all levels remain about 70% male. But if anything, that makes it all the more striking that many of the most authoritative voices we will hear, in the run-up to Reeves’s autumn budget, will be female. Aside from straightforward fairness, there are at least three potential benefits of this feminisation of the economic debate. The first, which Reeves herself has talked about directly, is the simple power of e ample: giving girls and young women the perception they could do jobs such as these. And while it must have been shattering, shedding a few tears at the dispatch bo was a powerful part of that: many women of every age will have identified with her. Women just do cry more than men ( a YouGov poll in 2015 found that 45% of women had cried at least once a month in the past year; for men, it was 11%). This has zero bearing on their ability to do their job – and if anything, may point to sincerity, rather than insouciance. Whatever you think of their policies, Theresa May’s tears as she resigned, surely reflected better on her character than David Cameron’s jaunty little hum. A second potential benefit of having women at the top of economic policymaking should be better decision-making. Jill Rutter, a former Treasury official and now senior research fellow at thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, recalls that back in the 1980s “there were virtually no women around the table making ta policy decisions, and it was very interesting, because almost all the senior people there had non-working wives”. She recalls being stared at if, as the junior official present, she piped up to ask how a particular policy might go down with women. Four decades later, Boris Johnson’s bloke-heavy government was apparently capable of similar myopia. When senior Cabinet Office official Helen MacNamara testified at the Covid inquiry, she argued that senior women’s voices were all but absent from decision-making in the pandemic. “Decisions were being taken where the impact on women was either lost or ignored,” she said in her written evidence . skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion MacNamara pointed to a lack of consideration about the demands that school closures would place on families; the potential impact of lockdown on domestic violence victims; and the rules around pregnancy and birth. By contrast, she said, time was found to discuss the implications for “hunting, shooting and fishing”. Across today’s economic landscape, there are plenty of pressing issues women may feel particularly moved to pursue – not least the gender pay gap (13%) , which Reeves has pledged to narrow, and its less-noticed sister, the gender pensions gap ( standing at a shocking 35% for private pension savings ), which the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, is e pected to highlight in a speech on Monday. The third and more speculative potential upside of having more female economic policymakers, is a shift in the tone of debate. Not all women are moderate, or reasonable, or ground their arguments in the everyday – Liz Truss is certainly a countere ample – but I would gently suggest that on average, they tend to be a bit less prone to bluster, bravado, and what the kids call “ main character syndrome ”. That was why it was depressing on Tuesday to see Reeves at the Mansion House, describing regulation as the “boot on the neck” of British enterprise, in danger of “choking off” innovation. No doubt the violent language was aimed at grabbing headlines (which it did) and communicating a clear message to her City audience. But it was jarring to read such a brute phrase in a public speech by the UK’s most powerful woman. There is no shortage of tedious macho language around Keir Starmer – with anonymous briefers proudly telling columnists the prime minister’s politics are “hard Labour”, and accusing MPs of “knobheadery”. Perhaps as her crunch autumn budget approaches, Reeves can help the government to find a different, more relatable vocabulary. Judging by the comments of that mainly female panel at the Institute for Government debate on Labour’s first year in power last week, the debate in the coming months will be every bit as robust as ever. But it will be fascinating to see if it can be conducted in a different, calmer way: and perhaps more closely anchored to what MacNamara argued was missing from that shameful Johnson period: people, and families, and how people actually live their lives.

Welsh town reacts to Labour and Reform’s visions for future In the final part of a series, we look at the political battle for Bridgend after the closure of its Ford plant Battle over solar as Reform UK attacks net zero Teesside divided over net zero How a refinery closure is hitting jobs and politics Why Reform is targeting manufacturing heartlands “I t’s sad. I think it killed the town,” says Debbie, sitting in a cafe in Bridgend and recalling the closure of Ford’s south Wales engine plant almost five years ago. “There were lots of men and women working there at the end.” During its 40 years of operations, workers at Bridgend Ford produced 22m engines for Ford, Volvo and Jaguar cars, before it closed quietly in September 2020 during ongoing Covid restrictions . Debbie’s husband was one of 1,700 people who worked for the biggest employer in the town , located between Cardiff and Swansea, when the factory’s closure was announced in 2019. After about 30 years of service, he took early retirement in his late 50s when he received his redundancy payment. At the time, many other Ford workers pinned their hopes on taking their skills to a car plant planned for a neighbouring industrial estate by the chemicals company Ineos, where it intended to build its Grenadier 4 4 vehicle. However, the company owned by billionaire Bre it-backer Sir Jim Ratcliffe subsequently cancelled the development , opting to build the “British” vehicle in France.

Photograph: Dmitris Legakis/The Guardian “Ford workers still meet up,” says Debbie, highlighting the ongoing feeling of community. However, the closure led to the workforce scattering to various other employers – including carmaker Aston Martin’s plant at nearby St Athan – while others retrained. “Welsh cloud region” Coming up for five years later, the Ford site is still empty, but an industry of the future has big plans. The US-based datacentre company Vantage bought the land for a reported £27.5m in 2024 , the biggest industrial transaction in south Wales last year. In recent weeks it has submitted a planning application to the council to build a huge datacentre comple on the site, representing a multibillion-pound investment. “We recognise the importance of industry in Bridgend,” says Vantage in its application, stating that the cluster of 10 datacentres will “lay the foundation for future prosperity and regional economic regeneration”. View image in fullscreen Many locals bemoan the state of public services in Bridgend. Photograph: Athena Pictures/Kara Thomas Future prosperity may, however, be some way off. Subject to gaining planning approval, Vantage intends to start construction early next year, and will build the comple over three phases up to 2040. Once operational, it is pledging 600 full-time jobs on site, with a further 350 in the supply chain. It says the average salary of Vantage employees is £75,000, more than double the average salary in Bridgend, or Wales. The company, backed by a consortium of investors including DigitalBridge Group, Silver Lake, Australian Super and others already operates one datacentre 30 miles east along the M4 motorway at Newport and has received planning permission for another in the Vale of Glamorgan. Vantage writes in its planning statement to the council that these three locations would “form the cornerstone of a Welsh cloud region”. A company spokesperson said its e pansion in south Wales was linked to “many factors … from the availability of land, power and skilled labour to the support of the local councils and national government, and customer demand”. The company also estimates the development will help the town by generating £8.3m a year in business rates for the local authority, although in Wales these are pooled between councils and distributed centrally.

Photograph: Athena Pictures/Kara Thomas More money for the area would clearly be welcomed by locals, many of whom bemoan the state of public services. On a sweltering weekday morning, groups of retired women are dodging soaring temperatures inside Bridgend’s Aroma cafe. Many are former colleagues meeting for regular coffee catch-ups, where the lack of local public transport or the disappointing state of Bridgend’s town centre with many vacant stores are common themes. “It’s all right if you vape, or want a Turkish barber,” says Susan, sitting at one of the tables. “You don’t come into town if you want an outfit.” Home of heavy industry Many in Bridgend feel they have heard promises from large companies before. While the town itself was never home to heavy industry, the surrounding region relied on it, and the Tata steelworks at Port Talbot is just 14 miles up the road. When Ford opened in 1980, the area was already home to dozens of car parts companies and it was hoped the automotive sector would take the place of a declining coal industry, which employed 250,000 in Wales at its peak. Significant numbers of Welsh miners took part in the miners’ strike , led by Arthur Scargill and the National Union of Mineworkers. While the action ultimately failed to prevent pit closures, it left a lasting legacy in Wales’s coalmining heartlands. In the aftermath of the strike, Wales had some success in attracting foreign investment, often to Bridgend, helped by its pro imity to the M4. However, many locals can reel off a list of the large multinationals that have come and gone, including LG and Bosch. While Ford’s closure did not cause a rise in unemployment in Bridgend, where it remains about 3.5%, according to official figures, the economic inactivity rate – measuring people neither in work nor looking for a job – has climbed 6% since the pandemic. While this picture is repeated across the UK since Covid, the rate in Bridgend stands at 30.6%, significantly higher than the British average of 21%. The main political parties are looking for ways to tackle persistent economic problems, but have differing views on how best to achieve it. Reform UK is hoping to capitalise on voters’ dissatisfaction, in a town that voted 54.6% for leave in the Bre it referendum, at a time when it is setting out its stall in Wales before next May’s elections for the Welsh parliament . View image in fullscreen Caroline Jones says Bridgend town centre ‘lacks vibrancy’. Photograph: Athena Pictures/Kara Thomas “The town centre is lacking vibrancy,” says Caroline Jones, who hopes to be selected as Reform’s candidate for the Senedd for Bridgend. . Recalling a busier time, when the high street was home to more shops and bank branches, she says: “Our aim is to enhance town centres, to bring local employment and to level up the playing field.” Jones, who previously served as the Senedd member for south west Wales for Ukip and as an independent, was Reform’s candidate for Bridgend in last year’s general election, coming second to Labour with a 19% share of the vote. “I want to see industry and manufacturing brought back into our area, which obviously needs a lot of planning,” she adds. It is unclear how Reform intends to attract this investment, and many of the policies Jones and the party are proposing – including lowering corporation ta or raising the income ta threshold to £20,000 – are not devolved powers and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the Senedd. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Back to the future It is perhaps unsurprising that Reform’s leader, Nigel Farage, launched his party’s campaign for the 2026 Senedd elections in nearby Port Talbot, where 2,500 jobs at the steelworks have been lost after the closure of the blast furnaces. It was where he made his pitch to Welsh voters, vowing to reopen closed coalmines and restart blast furnaces to usher in a new era of domestic steel making, fuelled by Welsh coal. The party has not yet named its leader in Wales and does not have any Senedd members. However, since Farage’s June visit to Port Talbot, Reform has topped two polls of voting intentions, with nationalists Plaid Cymru in second, pushing Labour into third place. Such an outcome would be a serious defeat for Welsh Labour, which has run the government in Cardiff ever since devolution nearly 27 years ago. The first minister, Eluned Morgan, is hoping to overturn a slump in voter support for Labour, but has said she is taking the threat of Reform “very seriously” . However, even if Reform wins the largest number of seats in the Senedd, a new more proportional voting system makes it unlikely it will be able to form a majority government . Reform has just gained its first councillor, the youngest ever in the borough of Bridgend, in the shape of Owain Clatworthy, who clinched a surprise council byelection win in May, just days before his 21st birthday. View image in fullscreen Owain Clatworthy clinched a surprise council byelection win for Reform in May. Photograph: Athena Pictures/Kara Thomas He has already gained some local recognition. Being photographed by the Guardian outside the council offices, a passerby claps him on the shoulder and congratulates him on “doing a fine job”. Clatworthy grew up in care from the age of si and now helps others in a similar situation as a support worker, but insists a job in heavy industry would appeal to some of his peers. “I don’t doubt that if you ask a young person who is struggling to get by, like I was a couple of years ago, I’d have snatched your arm off to maybe get down the mines,” Clatworthy says. “Coal runs through our veins in Wales,” says Bridgend resident Carwyn Jones, a former first minister of Wales and now a Labour peer, “but the mines have been flooded, capped, built over”. He does not believe Wales’s future prosperity lies in a return to past industries. “A word I’d use to describe it, which is a particularly technical term, is bonkers,” he says. “Is that what we are saying to people, ‘That’s what the Welsh want, to be stuck down a hole in the ground again’?” View image in fullscreen Former first minister Carwyn Jones outside the Ford engine plant in June 2019. Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures In recent decades Bridgend has moved away from reliance on one large employer, Jones says, which makes the town “economically safer”. “We’ve got all these hidden gems,” he says, listing hi-tech local companies including Spectrum Technologies, which makes laser-marking equipment for aircraft wires and cables. “Green shoots” A burst of industry is visible and audible in the town centre, where there is a cluster or cranes and workers in hi-vis. Bridgend College’s new campus is under construction, scheduled to open next September. The £75m project will bring 1,000 of the college’s 7,500 students and staff into central Bridgend, which the principal, Vivienne Buckley, believes will help regeneration efforts, while it is hoped the campus theatre will bolster the growing night-time economy. “It’s the biggest investment that’s gone into Bridgend in generations,” says Buckley of the scheme which is two-thirds funded by the Welsh government, with the remaining third covered by the college. “People in Bridgend are e cited about it. It’s not a panacea, but a huge opportunity.” The vocational further education college retrained some of Ford’s workers and has been responsible for training Tata Steel’s apprentices for 15 years. However, the region’s shift away from manufacturing means Bridgend’s future workers require different skills. View image in fullscreen Vivienne Buckley hopes the new Bridgend College campus will help the regeneration of the town centre. Photograph: Dmitris Legakis/The Guardian “What we need to do is produce students who are able to adapt to the needs of the workforce they enter,” she says . “Even 10 years ago it was more about a bespoke skill set, now industry seems to be looking for a broad base of knowledge that can be moulded into what they need.” Bridgend’s Labour MP, Chris Elmore, whose constituency now includes the town, after boundary changes, insists there are “green shoots” in the local economy, listing the college development, new hospitality venues and housing developments. Elmore has been lobbying for an AI growth zone in south Wales, and is hopeful such projects could be achieved through better cooperation between Labour-run administrations in Westminster and Cardiff. “I think actually that relationship [between the UK government and Welsh Labour] is beginning to show positive signs, and it’s our job to make that case.” However, it is unclear whether Bridgend residents will be patient if they don’t see improvements to the local area and public services. Back at the Aroma cafe, there is a weariness with the Labour-run Welsh government, but little appreciation for Reform either. “I am not staunch Labour come hell and high water like many here,” says Ann. “I voted independent in the last election.” “I don’t like Nigel Farage at all,” adds Jennifer Owen. “I think he is a dangerous man.” E plore more on these topics Automotive industry Rise of the right Economics Ford Nigel Farage Regeneration Communities Wales features Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed",

Business Trump visits Federal Reserve and tussles with Jerome Powell in e traordinary moment Updated July 24, 2025 7:02 PM ET Originally published July 24, 2025 5:07 PM ET By Rafael Nam President Trump sparred with Fed Chair Jerome Powell over the final cost of the Federal Reserve's renovations during an unusual visit to the central bank. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Trump visited the Federal Reserve on Thursday to inspect an ongoing renovation of the central bank's Washington, D.C., buildings — and in an unusual moment, then disagreed with Fed Chair Jerome Powell about the final cost of the project. Economy Why the Federal Reserve's building renovations are attracting the White House's ire The Fed's e pensive renovation project has become a point of contention as the president seeks to pressure the central bank to lower interest rates more quickly. The renovation's cost has soared from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion in recent years. During the visit, Trump and Powell, accompanied by Sen. Tim Scott, the South Carolina Republican chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, stopped to address news cameras. Trump, waving a document, claimed the costs had now reached $3.1 billion as Powell visibly shook his head in disagreement. \"So we're taking a look, and it looks like it's about 3.1 billion [dollars],\" Trump said. \"Went up a little bit — or a lot.\" \"I haven't heard that from anybody at the Fed,\" Powell responded. The Fed chair then took the document, looked at it and said the additional costs the president was citing had been for a separate building whose construction was completed five years ago. Trump then appeared more conciliatory as reporters shouted questions. \"I don't want to be personal. I just would like to see it get finished,\" Trump said, referring to the renovations. \"And in many ways, it's too bad it started, but it did start. And, and it's been under construction for a long time.\" Trump also appeared to avoid delving into his recent criticisms of Powell. \"Well, I'd love him to lower interest rates, but other than that, what can I tell you?\" Trump said as Powell chuckled. Powell appears before the Senate Banking Committee on June 25 as part of his semiannual testimony before Congress. Kent Nishimura/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Kent Nishimura/Getty Images Trump later seeks to ease tensions Later, Trump again addressed reporters — this time without Powell — and sought to ease tensions from his earlier appearance. \"I thought we had a good meeting,\" Trump told reporters. \"No, there was no tension. There was no tension.\" Interview highlights A well-run economy needs an independent Federal Reserve, says former reserve bank head In the run-up to Thursday's visit to the Fed, Trump had been relentlessly attacking Powell, describing the Fed chair as a \"numbskull\" and as \"too late\" to cut interest rates. In his second appearance before the press on Thursday, Trump again called for lower borrowing costs, although he said he felt \"good\" about his relationship with Powell. \"I believe that the chairman is going to do the right thing, maybe a little too late, as the e pression goes, but I believe he's going to do the right thing,\" Trump said. An unusual visit in more ways than one Trump's visit marks the first time a president has visited the Federal Reserve since 2006, when President George W. Bush attended the swearing-in of Ben Bernanke, a previous chair of the central bank. That's because the Fed has long protected its independence in setting interest rates, which is critical in retaining the confidence of global investors. Presidents in modern times have mostly respected the Fed's independence and sought to avoid being seen as interfering with its decisions. The Fed has held interest rates steady this year, in large part over concerns that the president's tariffs could spark an increase in inflation. The latest data showed consumer prices rising 2.7% from a year ago , at a faster clip than the previous month. That uptick makes it unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its next policy meeting, later this month, despite Trump's pressure. Trump has threatened to fire Powell Trump's frustrations boiled over last week when he threatened to fire Powell . Later, he backed down — without fully ruling it out. The Fed has not responded to Trump's criticism, but Powell has previously made clear he intends to serve out his term as Fed chair, which e pires next May. Last year, when asked whether he would resign if Trump requested it, Powell responded with an emphatic \"No.\" Politics Trump floats firing the Federal Reserve chair as White House criticism boils Economy Fed holds interest rates steady, signals rate cuts of 0.5% later this year An attempt to fire Powell would likely roil financial markets and lead to a huge legal fight. Legal scholars believe a Fed chair can be fired only \"for cause,\" such as for breaking the law. The Trump administration's attacks against the Fed renovation project are seen as another way to ramp up pressure on Powell and as potentially a reason to fire him — though legal scholars have said such an e cuse is unlikely to pass legal muster . The Fed chair has previously pushed back, attributing the cost overruns to mitigations for lead and asbestos, as well as to inflation, which has raised the cost of building projects nationwide.

But the federal government has long had a role in this equation. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The Trump administration has made big public investments in private businesses, from a rare earth mineral company to U.S. steel. But it's not e actly a new idea. The U.S. used to have a national investment bank that did just that. Wailin Wong and Darian Woods of NPR's The Indicator have more. WAILIN WONG, BYLINE: In January 1932, the U.S. was in the throes of the Great Depression. President Herbert Hoover and Congress created a new bank-like institution called the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, or the RFC, and it had a mission that, at the time, was relatively novel for the government. It would e tend emergency credit to businesses in danger of going bankrupt. DARIAN WOODS, BYLINE: President Hoover assembled a board of directors for this new entity, the RFC. WONG: That same year, 1932, Hoover lost the presidential election to Franklin Roosevelt in a landslide. But the RFC survived the change in administration. WOODS: Chris Hughes is the author of a book called \"Marketcrafters: The 100-Year Struggle To Shape The American Economy.\" Chris says, the RFC had three phases of its life. The first one was the emergency phase, and it kicked in right as Roosevelt took office. CHRIS HUGHES: So the weekend that Roosevelt is inaugurated, he declares a bank, quote-unquote, \"holiday\" all across the country and shuts down virtually all of the American banks. And so over the coming weeks and months, the RFC is working to recapitalize these banks. WONG: This stabilizing role is reminiscent of what the Federal Reserve does, but the Reconstruction Finance Corporation went further than lending money to banks in trouble. It had the authority from the government to actually buy stakes in these banks. By September of 1934, the RFC was a partial owner of half of the banks in the U.S. WOODS: But despite that massive investment into the banking system, the Depression got worse, and the RFC moved into its second phase of life. HUGHES: As the Depression gets bleaker and bleaker, they then begin investing in all kinds of cutting-edge industries. And at that point, housing is actually the most important one for them to invest in. WOODS: That's because the housing industry employed a lot of workers, and of course, it was building something that people needed. But Americans had to be able to afford these new homes, so the RFC took another step. HUGHES: The RFC creates Fannie Mae, creates the 30-year mortgage to make it cheaper and easier for people to buy. WONG: This was a major legacy of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It not only created the 30-year mortgage, it also created the market for trading government-backed mortgages, a financial market that still e ists today. WOODS: And the RFC's second phase of life involved investing in agriculture and railroads. Plus, it lent money to businesses that couldn't get credit from skittish private banks. WONG: The Second World War really got the U.S. economy going, and this era is when the Reconstruction Finance Corporation enters its third phase of life. It financed American airplane manufacturing and training schools for pilots. WOODS: Chris says the RFC was disassembled after the war, but parts of the RFC have endured, though. We mentioned Fannie Mae and the 30-year mortgage earlier. There's also the Commodity Credit Corporation, which is this agency that supports farmers by purchasing crops and making loans. WONG: And Chris says there have also been attempts to do similar things as the RFC. President George W. Bush created a loan program under the Department of Energy in 2005. The idea was to finance clean energy projects, and it continued during the Obama and Biden administrations. WOODS: Darian Woods. WONG: Wailin Wong, NPR News. Copyright NPR.",

But home sales were actually at a nine-month low in the same period. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Home prices hit an all-time high last month. NPR's Laurel Wamsley covers personal finance and housing and is here with us now to talk us through what this means. Good morning, Laurel. LAUREL WAMSLEY, BYLINE: Hey, Michel. MARTIN: So anybody who's been in the market knows this - home prices were already high, and now they've hit a new record. Can you give us the - you know, the depressing details? WAMSLEY: Yeah, that's right. The National Association of Realtors released the June sales figures for existing homes, and they were really notable for two things. One is these high prices. The median sales price for an existing home last month was $435,300. That's the highest ever and up nearly 50% from just five years ago. Given that, you know, you might think we're in a hot market. But, no, home sales in June were actually at a nine-month low. MARTIN: So e plain that. How can prices hit new records while the market is so slow? WAMSLEY: Well, yeah, it's a tale of two kinds of buyers. Some people do have a lot of money to spend. Wages keep rising, and people who have the home to sell can use profits from these high prices to buy their next one. Here's Jessica Lautz, Deputy Chief Economist at the National Association of Realtors. JESSICA LAUTZ: Today's housing market is really haves and have-nots. Those who have housing equity can make housing trades right now. Many of them are doing so, even with an all-cash purchase. They have the ability to interact with today's housing market, where first-time homebuyers are being shut out. WAMSLEY: You can see this in the fact that it was the top of the market that was strongest last month. Homes priced over a million dollars saw sales increase the most, and that really is pulling up prices. You know, and then there's the rest of us. You know, some folks are biting the bullet and just paying a lot for a house after having saved for years or gotten help from family, but not many. And many more would love to buy a house right now, but they just can't afford it because another factor that's keeping some buyers out is the high mortgage rates. MARTIN: OK, could you talk more about mortgage rates? What effect are they having on the market? WAMSLEY: Yeah, a significant effect. I mean, rates are about 6.75% right now for a 30-year mortgage, which Lautz notes has been pretty level since January. LAUTZ: But it is pricing out buyers, and we also know the lock-in effect is real. People who have lower-interest-rate mortgages are just not willing to make this move right now unless they have a lot of housing equity. WAMSLEY: You know, there are significantly more homes for sale than there were a year ago, though inventory is still lower than it was pre-pandemic. For those who are trying to enter the market, buy their first home, these high rates on top of high prices mean they simply can't make the numbers work. They can add hundreds or thousands of dollars to a monthly payment. Though if mortgage rates did drop, as many people would like to see, that would create more demand and probably push home prices up even more. MARTIN: Yeah, that sounds complicated. OK, so you were reminding us that these are existing homes we're talking about. Is the picture any different for new homes? WAMSLEY: Well, interestingly, new homes used to be more e pensive than old ones because they have all the new bells and whistles. But lately, the median prices are pretty similar. And in some places, new homes might be cheaper because of the incentives that homebuilders are able to offer. But as we look down the road, unfortunately, the same interest rates that are keeping mortgage rates elevated are making it more e pensive to build new homes. Permits for new construction dropped to more than a two-year low, and that hit to supply isn't great for housing prices in the months and years ahead. MARTIN: That is NPR's Laurel Wamsley. Laurel, thank you. WAMSLEY: You're welcome. Copyright NPR.",

Home prices hit an all-time high in June , and sales dropped to a nine-month low as hopeful first-time buyers shied away, likely due to elevated mortgage rates and high listing prices. \"People aren't able to buy a house because this guy is a numbskull,\" Trump said in the Oval Office this week referring to Fed Reserve Chair Powell. \"He keeps the rates too high and probably doing it for political reasons.\" But Robert Reich, who served as Labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, told Morning Edition that the move Trump wants could backfire, putting an already seemingly unreachable goal further out of reach for many Americans. Here are three thoughts Reich, now a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, shared in an interview with NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer about lowering interest rates and what the Trump administration could actually do to lower prices. The Fed cutting interest rates could make mortgages cheaper, but … In terms of simple math, Reich says housing can get less e pensive if the Fed cuts interest rates and that causes mortgage rates to go down. \"I can buy a house more cheaply because I can get a loan to buy that house more cheaply,\" Reich said. But cutting interest rates might not cause mortgage rates to fall, Reich noted, because it could lead to questions about the Fed's credibility in fighting inflation. National Frustrated by NIMBYs, states are trying to force cities to build affordable housing \"If investors believe that the Fed is really not serious about fighting inflation by raising or keeping interest rates high, then ironically, mortgage rates are going to not fall. They're going to potentially rise,\" Reich said. And markets take into account the risk of long-term inflation, he added. \"They're taking the possibility that next year or the year after, prices are going to go up, that inflation is going to get out of control,\" Reich said. \"Markets are responding to what markets assume are going to be the incentives operating upon the Fed.\" A rush of demand could make homebuying harder. If the Fed decided to cut interest rates because it independently finds that inflation is less of a challenge, Reich said the basics of supply and demand would play a big role in home prices. \"Then it's possible that there is more of a demand for housing. That greater demand for housing without corresponding increase in the number of housing units available could push up prices,\" Reich said. Business President Trump indicates he'll let Fed Chair Jerome Powell serve out his term Meeting demand through new builds right now is tough — and tariffs aren't helping. Reich said he doesn't e pect to see very much new housing being built because builders are \"facing among the worst of circumstances.\" The construction of new homes has been iffy this yea r. Last month, builders were requesting fewer permits, starting fewer homes and completing fewer housing units compared to a year earlier, according to Census Bureau data . Trump's tariffs may also be playing a role, as materials used in construction are now more costly to bring into the country. The National Association of Home Builders says Canadian lumber and other materials like steel and aluminum, as well as home appliances, all face steeper tariffs and are pushing up costs. Reich said the White House could reduce homebuying costs by lowering its tariffs, which would allow building equipment and materials to the U.S. at lower costs. He added that making it easier for builders to get permits and for builders and states and localities to comply with a variety of housing regulations may also help. \"Now, it's easy to say all these things,\" Reich said. \"Other administrations have tried to bring housing prices down, but it's very difficult.\" This digital article was edited by Treye Green.

His comment comes as he and his administration continue to attack Powell. Business President Trump indicates he'll let Fed Chair Jerome Powell serve out his term July 22, 2025 3:01 PM ET By Rafael Nam President Trump with Jerome Powell after nominating him as chair in 2017. Drew Angerer/Getty Images North America hide caption toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images North America President Trump indicated on Tuesday he would let Jerome Powell serve out his term as Federal Reserve chair, saying \"he's going to be out pretty soon anyway.\" The comment comes as the president has relentlessly attacked Powell in recent weeks for not cutting interest rates. Politics Trump floats firing the Federal Reserve chair as White House criticism boils Last week, Trump floated the idea of firing Powell before retreating somewhat and adding he's \"not planning\" to fire the Fed chair, though without fully ruling it out. An attempt to fire Powell could spark a legal battle, because the Federal Reserve is set up to function as an independent body free of political interference. Such a move would likely also roil financial markets. On Tuesday, while answering questions from reporters, Trump again attacked Powell for being too cautious on cutting interest rates. \"I call him too late. He's too late all the time,\" Trump said. \"He should have lowered interest rates many times.\" He went on to say that Powell is leaving his post soon enough anyway, indicating he was willing to wait out his term as chair of the Fed, which ends on May of next year. Despite the president's attacks, Powell has been adamant he intends to serve out his term as chair. The Fed has held interest rates steady this year in large part over concerns that President Trump's tariffs could spark an increase on inflation. That's after cutting rates by a full percentage point between September and December last year. With concerns over inflation rising again, the Fed is seen as unlikely to cut rates at its next policy meeting later this month. In June, consumer prices rose 2.7% from a year ago , a faster annual clip than in the previous month. Policy makers had previously indicated they may consider cutting rates by half a percentage point later this year. Trump administration steps up pressure on Powell Top government officials have also stepped up their criticism of Powell's tenure at the Fed. On Monday, in a post on social media platform , Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for \"a review\" of the Fed's operations, saying the central bank had e cessively e tended its purview into areas outside of its core job of setting interest rates. Bessent also called for a review of the Fed's renovation project, which President Trump and some Republican lawmakers have seized on to further attack Powell. The Fed is embarking on a makeover of its offices in Washington, D.C., with the cost of the project soaring from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion in recent years. Powell has pushed back against some of the most sensational claims of the renovations as e aggerated. The Fed has attributed the cost overruns to une pected developments like e cess lead and asbestos, as well as inflation, which has raised the cost of building projects nationwide. Powell has also asked the Fed's inspector general to review the project, in an effort to address complaints about the price tag. Federal Reserve Jerome Powell trump Fed Chair Flipboard",

      "content": "L’animosité entre le président américain et le dirigeant de la banque centrale américaine ne faiblit pas. Donald Trump, venu inspecter jeudi la Fed , a eu un échange tendu avec le patron de l'institution, Jerome Powell, à qui il a demandé à nouveau de baisser les tau , mais sans aller l'invectiver en face-à-face comme il l'a fait par réseau sociau et caméras interposés ces dernières semaines, de manière répétée. À découvrir L’info même en vacances avec l’app Le Figaro Le républicain de 79 ans est venu observer un grand chantier de rénovation de l'imposant bâtiment à Washington. Le banquier central a contesté, en secouant vigoureusement la tête, un chiffrage du coût des travau de 3,1 milliards de dollars avancé par le président américain, au lieu de 2,7 milliards au départ. «Je ne suis pas au courant» , a-t-il dit. Chaussant ses lunettes et e aminant un papier que lui tendait Donald Trump devant les journalistes, Jerome Powell a souligné que le républicain avait ajouté dans son estimation un «troisième bâtiment» . «C’est un bâtiment qui est en cours de construction» , a lancé le président, coiffé comme son hôte d’un casque de chantier. «Non, il a été construit il y a cinq ans» , a rétorqué le patron de la Fed. Passer la publicité Publicité Donald Trump avait récemment estimé que le chantier de rénovation pouvait avoir donné lieu à une «fraude» , alimentant les spéculations sur un renvoi du patron de la Réserve fédérale. Le président républicain l’avait nommé pendant son premier mandat (), puis Jerome Powell avait été reconduit par le démocrate Joe Biden. Mais il assure regretter amèrement ce choi et accable régulièrement le banquier central de critiques virulentes. À «J’aimerais qu’il démissionne» : Jerome Powell, le patron de la Fed devenu souffre-douleur de Donald Trump «Pas au courant» «J’aimerais qu’il baisse les tau d’intérêt» , a encore dit le président américain à ses côtés. Un peu plus tard, pendant un rapide point presse, Donald Trump s'est dit convaincu que Jerome Powell «ferait ce qu'il faut» , alors que la prochaine réunion des responsables de la Réserve fédérale américaine (Fed) sur les tau est prévue les 29 et 30 juillet. Le dirigeant républicain a nié toute «tension» pendant la rencontre et assuré qu'il n'avait pas fait «pression» pour une démission. «Il devrait avoir baissé les tau d'intérêt plusieurs fois» , avait déploré mardi Donald Trump, en ajoutant : «Les gens n'arrivent pas à acheter de maison parce que ce gars est un nigaud. Il maintient des tau trop élevés et il le fait sans doute pour des raisons politiques.» La banque centrale américaine, institution indépendante dont les décisions et commentaires ont un impact immense sur les marchés, a maintenu les tau d'intérêt stables cette année. Elle repousse jusqu'ici l'idée d'une baisse dans un conte te rendu incertain par l'offensive protectionniste mondiale de Donald Trump, qui pourrait faire grimper les pri . Les tau directeurs de la Fed - qui guident les coûts d'emprunt des particuliers et des entreprises - sont compris entre 4,25% et 4,50% depuis décembre. La Banque centrale européenne, à laquelle Donald Trump se réfère souvent, a, elle, baissé progressivement son tau directeur, passé de 4% en juin 2024 à 2% aujourd'hui. Le président américain avait reconnu récemment qu'il était très peu probable qu'il renvoie le patron de la Fed, en théorie inamovible ou presque. Un tel licenciement serait sans précédent, et nécessiterait de prouver l'e istence de fautes graves ou de malversations de la part du très pondéré banquier central de 72 ans, dont le mandat s'achève en mai 2026. Les tau d'intérêt sont le principal outil des banques centrales pour orienter l'économie. Baisser les tau encourage l'activité, mais peut faire monter les pri . Augmenter les tau permet de lutter contre l'inflation, mais peut freiner la croissance.",

Avec 48,6 milliards d'euros de biens e portés vers les États-Unis en 2024, dont l'essentiel par 14.700 entreprises des secteurs marchands (hors biens agricoles et financiers), le pays est la deu ième destination d'e portation de la France en valeur derrière l'Allemagne (78 milliards d'euros). À découvrir L’info même en vacances avec l’app Le Figaro Alors que le dénouement des négociations sur les droits de douane entre l'Union européenne (UE) et les États-Unis est espéré le 1 er août, les discussions se poursuivent et un accord semblait se dessiner ces derniers jours avec des droits de douane américains ramenés à 15%, assortis d'e emptions dans le secteur aéronautique ou pharmaceutique.

À Quels sont les 11 départements français les plus vulnérables au droits de douane de Donald Trump ? Passer la publicité Publicité Tau de marge faible pour certaines entreprises La moitié des droits de douane additionnels pourrait donc peser sur environ 2000 entreprises françaises qui réalisent les trois quarts des e portations de matériel de transport (construction aéronautique et navale), de boissons ou de produits de la maroquinerie vers les États-Unis, indique l'étude. La capacité de ces entreprises à résister au choc de cette nouvelle donne douanière réside notamment dans les tau de marge : un tau élevé peut-être réduit par une entreprise afin de «conserver sa clientèle» ou d' «absorber en tout ou partie la hausse des droits de douane pour ses clients en abaissant ses pri » , ajoute le document. Le tau de marge des entreprises e portatrices vers le marché américain s'établit en moyenne à 35,5% en 2024, contre 27,9% pour des entreprises en France en 2022, avec des situations contrastées selon la taille ou le secteur d'activité. Ainsi, un quart de ces entreprises ont un tau de marge inférieur à 11%, et un quart supérieur à 52,1%, relève l'étude. Dans l'hypothèse où les entreprises tenteraient de neutraliser intégralement la hausse des pri en réduisant le tau de marge, elles devraient les réduire de 0,6 point avec des droits de douane de 10%, et de près de 2 points avec des droits de douane à 30%. Compte tenu de l'e position au marché américain et des tau de marge des entreprises, la situation serait «plus difficile pour les industries de fabrication de matériel de transport (construction aéronautique et navale)» et «pour les microentreprises et pour les entreprises indépendantes» , estiment les auteurs.",

      "content": "Un hommage à Louis Blériot, le premier homme à avoir traversé la Manche en avion le 25 juillet 1909. Et un vol de démonstration technologique grandeur nature. Franky Zapata n’a pas choisi la date du 25 juillet 2025 par hasard. L’ancien champion du monde de jet ski, devenu entrepreneur avec sa start-up éponyme, doit décoller de Sangatte (Pas-de-Calais), ce vendredi matin vers 10h, pour rallier Douvres, sur la côte britannique à bord de sa nouvelle invention : l’Air Scooter, un scooter volant destiné à servir le marché des loisirs et du tourisme, qu’il avait présenté voici deu ans. À découvrir L’info même en vacances avec l’app Le Figaro L’engin, qui se distingue avec son habitacle transparent de forme ovoïde, est un VTOL, un aéronef à décollage et atterrissage vertical à propulsion hybride (8 moteurs électriques et 4 thermiques). Ultra-léger (115 kilos sur la balance) grâce à sa structure en fibre de carbone, l’Air Scooter se pilote avec un joystick. Il peut voler à 3 000 mètres d’altitude à une vitesse de pointe de 100 km/heure et est doté d’un rayon d’action de 100 km et d’une autonomie oscillant en fonction de la vitesse, de 1H30 à 75 km/h à près de 2 heures à 45 km/h. « Je prévois de traverser la Manche en 25 minutes, en volant à 75 km/heure en moyenne à 2 800 mètres d’altitude. Ce vol, en démontrant que notre machine fonctionne, marque un moment de partage avec mes équipes qui y travaillent depuis des années », confie Franky Zapata. Passer la publicité Publicité Premier «Fly center» à Las Vegas au États-Unis Ce sera le premier vol longue distance pour l’Air Scooter, après un survol de 15 minutes, le 21 juin dernier, de l’étang de Berre, non loin de l’usine de conception et de fabrication de l’engin à Châteauneuf-les-Martigues (Bouches-du-Rhône). Mais ce n’est pas la première fois que Franky Zapata traverse la Manche, frappant les esprits avec une de ses inventions. En août 2019, il avait littéralement volé au-dessus de la mer, chaussé du Fly Board Air, la version aérienne du Flyboard (planche turbo propulsée) utilisé dans de nombreuses bases nautiques. Cela, après en avoir fait une démonstration, en clôture du défilé militaire du 14 juillet 2019, à Paris. Puis la jeune société a travaillé sur un prototype de voiture volante, le Jet Racer, et s’est lancée sur le marché des nouvelles mobilités aériennes avec l’Air Scooter. Ce dernier a bénéficié des acquis technologiques du Jet Racer et du Fly Board Air. L’engin est désormais prêt à embarquer ses premiers clients qui pourront le piloter avec une courte formation de di minutes via un programme de simulation téléchargée sur tablette. Le parcours touristique sera programmé sur l’ordinateur de bord de l’Air Scooter, générant automatiquement le trajet et la séquence de vol. «Le vol est géo-encadré», résume Franky Zapata. Pour s’offrir un vol, il faudra cependant se rendre au États-Unis, précisément à Las Vegas où la société Zapata ouvre son premier «Fly Center», un site en propre, cet automne. L’Air Scooter y commence sa carrière en bénéficiant de la réglementation sur les aéronefs ultra-légers (de 115 kilos ma imum) qui peuvent être e ploités sans licence de pilotage, ni certification. Ce qui n’est pas le cas en Europe où la réglementation sur les ultra-light s’applique au seuls ULM et impose de détenir une licence. Franky Zapata a d’ailleurs obtenu une dérogation pour faire voler l’Air Scooter entre la France et le Royaume-Uni auprès de la DGAC et de son homologue britannique, la CAA (Civil Aviation Authority). Premier vol du modèle biplace fin 2026 Afin de séduire les premiers clients Zapata lance, dès ce vendredi, une opération promotionnelle limitée dans le temps (jusqu’au 31 août sur le site airscooter.shop), avec la prévente des premiers tickets à 400 dollars l’heure, soit 100 dollars de moins que prévu, afin de s’offrir un vol inoubliable au-dessus du grand canyon et de ses environs. Un tarif qui devrait baisser au fur et à mesure du développement de l’activité car l’objectif à terme de Franky Zapata est « de démocratiser l’accès à la mobilité aérienne ». La société qui a déjà vendu 5 e emplaires de l’engin à des clients privés au États-Unis, organise, cet automne, une tournée américaine, avec plusieurs vols réalisés le long de la mythique route 66, de Chicago à Los Angeles. Financé à 100% par des capitau privés, dont Team Global, un « family office » allemand entré au capital en 2020 (à hauteur de quelque 5%), et le constructeur de motos et scooters indien TVS (5% pris récemment) basé à Chennai, Air Scooter a mobilisé un budget de quelque 10 millions d’euros. Après avoir lancé la fabrication des préséries, la production industrielle a été engagée et doit atteindre une centaine d’aéronefs en 2026 et à terme un millier par an. « Nous discutons d’un partenariat industriel avec TVS qui porte sur la fourniture de pièces de moteurs », précise le patron de Zapata. Passer la publicité Publicité « L’Air Scooter monoplace représente la première étape d’un projet plus vaste, avec le développement d’un aéronef dérivé doté d’une propulsion hybride avec des moteurs plus puissants. Ce sera un ta i volant biplace que nous devrons certifier », e plique Franky Zapatta. Ce deu ième VTOL doit, selon le calendrier prévisionnel, effectuer son premier vol d’essai fin 2026 puis s’engager dans le processus de certification par l’Agence européenne de la sécurité aérienne (Easa) et par la FAA, son homologue américaine. « Nous procédons par étapes avec d’abord le marché des loisirs et du tourisme puis le marché professionnel. L’Air Scooter biplace pourra être acheté ou loué par des aéroports, des compagnies aériennes pour transporter leur client mais aussi e ploité par nous-même », développe le patron de Zapata, qui ambitionne de réussir sur le marché des ta is volants, là où plusieurs start-up tel que Volocopter (elle devait faire voler le Volocity pendant les JO de Paris l’été dernier) ont échoué..",

Le reste des importations de produits manufacturiers britanniques restent soumises au droits de douane plancher de 10%.

Cette décision « concerne uniquement l’Union européenne» , assure l’entreprise de Mark Zuckerberg. «Nous continuons à penser que la publicité politique en ligne est un élément essentiel de la politique moderne.» Adopté en 2024 avec une pleine entrée en vigueur en octobre 2025, le règlement européen visé par Meta entend garantir une plus grande transparence et se prémunir des ingérences étrangères à l’approche d’élections. Il impose notamment au plateformes de signaler clairement les publicités à caractère politique et d’indiquer par qui elles sont financées.

Le marché de l’électrique, lui, commence à décoller, notamment grâce à l’Allemagne. Les ventes de 100% électriques sont en baisse de 6,4 % en France depuis le début 2025. (Ulrich Lebeuf/Myop pour Liberation) par Damien Dole publié aujourd'hui à 13h33 La crise du marché de l’automobile mondial se ressent sans surprise dans l’Union européenne (UE). Selon les chiffres de l’Association des constructeurs automobiles européens publiés jeudi 24 juillet, les ventes de voitures neuves ont chuté de 7,3 % dans l’UE en juin, comparé au même mois l’an dernier. Depuis le début de l’année, la baisse atteint 1,9 % sur un an. Seule bonne nouvelle : de janvier à juin, les voitures 100 % électriques progressent de 22 % sur le Vieu Continent par rapport à la même période en 2024. Une très bonne santé qui se ressent sur les quinze pays les plus importants en volumes de ventes. A l’e ception de la France, où les ventes chutent de 6,4 % depuis le début d’année. Stellantis dans le dur Dans le détail, rares sont les marques qui peuvent se réjouir de leur mois de juin : au sein des poids lourds du secteur, les allemands BMW et Mercedes, le tchèque Skoda et le français Renault figurent ainsi parmi les rares en croissance. Presque toutes les autres décrochent, parfois de plus de 10 %, comme les allemands Volkswagen et Audi, le français Citroën et l’italien Fiat (-38 % sur un an). La quinzaine de marques du franco-italien Stellantis reculent en moyenne de 16,1 % en juin, et plus de 11 % sur le premier semestre, ce qui montre l’étendue du chantier pour Antonio Filosa, le nouveau patron de l’entreprise . A Les ventes mondiales du groupe Renault progressent, notamment grâce à ses voitures hybrides et électriques Du côté des motorisations, le marché poursuit dans la direction entamée l’an dernier. Les hybrides non rechargeables captent plus du tiers du marché au premier semestre, même si la progression observée depuis plus d’un an s’est tassée en juin. Pourtant champion historique de l’hybride , Toyota ne parvient d’ailleurs pas à en tirer les bénéfices, puisque les ventes de la marque japonaise baissent de 8,6 % depuis le début de l’année. Les hybrides rechargeables (PHEV) commencent, elles, à décoller, avec 8,4 % de parts de marché en Europe, notamment grâce à l’Allemagne, l’Espagne et l’Italie. Heureusement pour le climat, l’essence et le diesel continuent, eu , de perdre du terrain, puisqu’en cumulé ces combustions historiques sombrent à 37,8 % de parts de marché, contre près de 53 % fin 2022 et… quelque 90 % en 2019. Si les voitures 100 % électriques comptent désormais pour 15,6 % des ventes dans l’UE, soit trois points de plus que l’an dernier, la France continue de peiner en la matière, avec une baisse de 6,4 % depuis le début de l’année (voitures), contre des hausses drastiques en Allemagne (unités, + 35,1 % sur un an) ou chez les voisins britanniques (voitures neuves, + 34,6 %). Illustration des transformations en cours dans le secteur, le leader historique Tesla n’en profite pas et poursuit sa descente au enfers , avec -43,7 % sur le premier semestre. A Véhicules électriques professionnels : les nouveau circuits Résultat, la part de 100 % électrique dans les ventes de voitures neuves continue de stagner en France, avec 17,6 % au premier semestre (ce qui reste mieu que la moyenne européenne), et même une légère baisse le mois dernier. La France vient de se faire doubler par l’Allemagne. La relance du leasing social à partir de fin du mois de septembre et l’augmentation du bonus écologique depuis début juillet pourraient permettre à la France de sortir de cette spirale négative. Les hybrides émettent trois fois plus de gaz à effet de serre que les 100 % électriques Il y a pourtant urgence à inverser le mi énergétique des voitures vendues dans l’UE. Confirmant d’autres études précédentes , l’International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) a publié début juillet un rapport montrant que si les voitures hybrides classiques et rechargeables émettent respectivement 20 % et 30 % d’émissions de gaz à effet de serre en moins que celles à essence, elles en émettent trois fois plus que les voitures 100 % électriques se rechargeant avec le mi électrique moyen de l’UE. Un calcul opéré sur tout le cycle de vie d’une voiture, en intégrant donc également le poids environnemental de la production d’une batterie mais aussi l’évolution du mi électrique européen dans les vingt prochaines années. «L’élimination progressive des nouvelles immatriculations de véhicules à combustion interne, de véhicules hybrides rechargeables et de véhicules hybrides non rechargeables d’ici 2035 permettrait d’aligner les émissions du secteur sur les objectifs climatiques de l’UE» , e plique l’ICCT.

A la Réunion, en 2014. (Nicolas Beaumont / Le Pictorium/Le Pictorium) par LIBERATION et AFP publié aujourd'hui à 12h12 C’est une première en France. Un distributeur automobile de l’île de la Réunion a été mis en e amen pour les blessures d’un conducteur d’un véhicule, liées à l’e plosion de son airbag Takata dont les défauts sont au cœur d’ un scandale industriel , soit une première en France, a-t-on appris ce vendredi 25 juillet de source proche du dossier. Automobile Airbags Takata défectueu : la trop lente prise de conscience de l’Etat et des constructeurs en France Le distributeur automobile Leal Réunion, qui conteste sa responsabilité, a été mis en e amen le 27 mars par un juge d’instruction de Saint-Pierre pour violation manifestement délibérée d’une obligation de sécurité ou de prudence ayant involontairement causé une incapacité totale de travail supérieure à trois mois. «Inertie» L’automobiliste, détenteur d’une BMW, avait été blessé lors d’un accident de circulation le 6 mai 2020. Gravement touché, notamment au visage, à cause de l’e plosion du gaz de l’airbag et la projection d’objets, la victime avait porté plainte. Lors de son interrogatoire, le 27 mars, un responsable de Leal Réunion a affirmé que sa société avait fait «tout [son] possible» pour avertir les utilisateurs de BMW et évoqué de nombreuses difficultés pour parvenir à les joindre. Mais une e pertise judiciaire a tempéré cette ligne de défense, évoquant l’ «inertie» de Leal qui n’aurait réellement commencé à avertir des détenteurs de BMW qu’ «à partir de juillet 2020, soit après l’accident» . D’après la source proche du dossier, la cour d’appel de Saint-Denis a été saisie mardi d’une demande de placement de Leal Réunion sous le statut plus favorable de témoin assisté. Outre divers arguments procédurau , Me Guillaume Martine, l’un des avocats de la société, «entend démontrer que Leal Réunion a mis en œuvre toutes les diligences possibles pour empêcher que ne surviennent des accidents, en tenant compte de la faible connaissance, à l’époque, de la dangerosité des airbags défectueu » . «Des pouvoirs publics moins mobilisés» à l’époque «Des entraves diverses e istaient, y compris de la part de pouvoirs publics qui étaient alors nettement moins mobilisés qu’ils ne le sont aujourd’hui» , a ajouté le conseil, alors que Leal Réunion affirme avoir sollicité en vain auprès de l’Etat l’accès au données du Système d’immatriculation des véhicules (SIV).

Carrefour veut se séparer de ses 1 188 magasins italiens qui ont rapporté 4 % du chiffre d’affaires du groupe en 2024. (Fiora Garenzi /Hans Lucas / AFP) par Emma Donada publié le 24 juillet 2025 à 20h57 L’enseigne Carrefour va disparaître des rues italiennes. Le groupe a annoncé la cession prochaine de l’ensemble de sa branche transalpine à un «pri symbolique» , selon les mots du directeur e écutif finances et gestion du groupe Matthieu Malige, à l’occasion de la présentation de ses résultats pour le premier semestre 2025, ce jeudi 24 juillet. Carrefour, qui reste dirigé par Ale andre Bompard et qui enregistre 30 % de baisse de résultat net par rapport au premier semestre 2024, veut se concentrer sur les marchés «porteurs » comme le Brésil, l’Espagne ou la France. Et il n’inclut pas l’Italie dans la liste. Au contraire, «après un redressement de 2020 à 2022, Carrefour Italie a enregistré un recul de son chiffre d’affaires, ainsi qu’un résultat opérationnel courant et un [flu de trésorerie disponible] négatifs en 2024, dans un conte te économique et concurrentiel particulièrement difficile», écrit le groupe dans un communiqué. Arrivée dans ce pays en 1993, l’enseigne veut donc se séparer de toutes ses activités dont ses 1 188 magasins qui ont rapporté un peu plus de 4 milliards d’euros en 2024, soit 4 % du chiffre d’affaires du groupe. A Carrefour en tête, Aldi dernier de la classe : Réseau Action Climat note la grande distribution Au début du mois de juillet, Carrefour avait déjà annoncé la suppression de 175 postes sur les 700 que compte siège situé à Milan, provoquant l’inquiétude des salariés. Le groupe avait alors justifié sa décision par «une concurrence intense et fragmentée, un pouvoir d’achat en baisse et une pression constante sur les marges, déterminée par les coûts de l’énergie et de la logistique et la hausse des tau d’intérêt», comme l’a alors rapporté la presse italienne . Reste que Carrefour est prêt à perdre 240 millions d’euros de trésorerie avec cette opération, en prenant en compte le montant de la contribution financière du groupe afin d’accompagner le projet de reprise. En échange, la société agro-alimentaire italienne NewPrinces, avec qui des négociations e clusives sont en cours, s’engage à réaliser un investissement minimum de 200 millions d’euros «afin de renforcer l’attractivité de la société sur le long terme». «La société continuera d’e ploiter la marque Carrefour sous licence pendant une période transitoire prévue dans le cadre d’un accord de services», précise le communiqué.

Eric Freymond est mort à 67 ans «près de son chalet de Saanen, dans le canton de Berne», selon «la Tribune de Génève». (DR) par LIBERATION et AFP publié le 24 juillet 2025 à 20h30 Le gestionnaire de fortune genevois Eric Freymond, accusé par l’un des héritiers du géant du lu e Hermès de l’avoir ruiné dans une mystérieuse affaire autour de la disparition de ses actions, s’est suicidé, a rapporté ce jeudi 24 juillet le quotidien la Tribune de Genève. Selon le journal suisse, ce banquier et mécène âgé de 67 ans est «décédé brutalement mercredi matin, près de son chalet de Saanen, dans le canton de Berne», plusieurs de ses proches affirmant qu’il «se serait ôté la vie volontairement». Freymond était au cœur d’une mystérieuse affaire non résolue sur laquelle avait longuement enquêté Libération autour des actions appartenant à Nicolas Puech, 82 ans, un arrière-petit-fils du fondateur de la maison française de maroquinerie Hermès. L’octogénaire avait accusé son ancien gestionnaire de fortune d’avoir fait disparaître ses actions et porté plainte contre lui. Enquête L’héritier d’Hermès, Bernard Arnault et le sulfureu gérant de fortune : les derniers mystères du casse du siècle La justice genevoise avait innocenté Eric Freymond, jugeant les accusations de Nicolas Puech «trop vagues et peu étayées», a rappelé la Tribune de Genève. Mais l’octogénaire avait déposé une plainte similaire en France. «Eric Freymond était d’une rare sensibilité, il a été brisé par la violence du soupçon, de la trahison et la dureté d’un monde sans indulgence», ont réagi François Zimeray et Jessica Finelle, deu de ses avocats, dans un communiqué transmis à l’AFP. Souvent décrit comme en froid avec le reste de sa famille, Nicolas Puech avait hérité de plus de 6 millions d’actions, soit 5,76 % du capital d’Hermès. Une des grandes questions dans ce dossier à rebondissements était de savoir si ces actions avaient été vendues ou non lorsque Bernard Arnault, le patron de LVMH , avait discrètement accumulé une participation dans son concurrent. L’affaire avait connu un nouveau soubresaut en 2023 lorsque Nicolas Puech avait affirmé être ruiné, et accusé son gestionnaire de fortune d’avoir utilisé de subtils montages financiers pour faire disparaître ses actions.

Le TER à Nantes, le 4 avril 2025. (Loïc Venance/AFP) par Ismérie Vergne et AFP publié le 24 juillet 2025 à 20h23 Le président de la SNCF ne pouvait pas rêver d’un meilleur cadeau de départ avant de quitter ses fonctions, vraisemblablement à l’automne. Pour sa dernière présentation de résultats financiers, Jean-Pierre Farandou a annoncé, jeudi 24 juillet, des bénéfices e ceptionnels pour le groupe ferroviaire au premier semestre 2025. 950 millions d’euros contre 143 millions au premier semestre 2024, soit un résultat net multiplié par plus de si . Ces performances sont en grande partie liées au bénéfices du gestionnaire d’infrastructure SNCF Réseau et de la compagnie ferroviaire SNCF Voyageurs. La bonne santé de SNCF Voyageurs, 10,4 milliards d’euros de chiffre d’affaires au premier semestre, est portée par la hausse globale du trafic sur les rails avec des trains de plus en plus remplis. La fréquentation du TGV, avec plus de 81,2 millions de passagers transportés, a progressé de 1,7 %, le TER de 3,9 % (même si la perte du service Marseille-Nice depuis fin juin pourrait légèrement affecter l’activité le reste de l’année), le Transilien, en région parisienne, de 6,5 % et Intercités de 3,1 %, toujours par rapport au premier semestre de l’an dernier. Tarifs de péages en hausse De son côté, SNCF Réseau, «le pivot du système» selon la direction du groupe, a amélioré sa marge de 300 millions d’euros grâce à une hausse de la circulation des trains sur son réseau et des tarifs de ses péages (de 2,5 % pour la grande vitesse et le fret, et de 6 % pour TER et Intercités). L’entreprise est donc en capacité de «continuer à investir massivement dans la régénération» des infrastructures, a souligné le directeur financier de la SNCF, Laurent Trevisani.

Le stand Calmann-Lévy au festival du livre de Paris, en avril 2023. (Stéphane Mouchemouche /Hans Lucas / AFP) par LIBERATION publié le 24 juillet 2025 à 19h21 «Le cumul des ventes de livres de Jordan Bardella, Nicolas Sarkozy, Philippe de Villiers et enia Federova, chez Fayard, est équivalent à la vente d’un seul livre de Guillaume Musso [publié par Calmann-Lévy, ndlr]. » Ce rappel acidulé est adressé à Arnaud Lagardère, PDG de Lagardère et d’Hachette Livre, dans les pages du Monde . Eliane Calmann-Lévy, l’héritière de la maison d’édition qui porte son nom, y attaque la ligne éditoriale des médias de l’empire du milliardaire Vincent Bolloré, qui selon elle déteint sur l’ensemble du groupe , et donc, sur sa propre boutique. «Déborder Bolloré» : l’offensive des éditions indépendantes dans la bataille culturelle contre l’e trême droite «La désormais coloration de droite nationaliste et le tropisme prorusse, avec notamment la présence au Journal du dimanche [JDD], de enia Fedorova [e -dirigeante de la chaîne de télévision RT France, et autrice chez Fayard, filiale d’Hachette, ndlr], propagandiste de Poutine, mettent très mal à l’aise la majorité des 66 000 collaborateurs de Vivendi-Lagardère et de Louis Hachette Group, de nombreu auteurs, sans compter des partenaires commerciau et des actionnaires», fait-elle ainsi savoir par l’intermédiaire du quotidien du soir. «Renouer avec une réelle neutralité politique» Eliane Calmann-Lévy suggère ensuite, en des termes choisis, que pour «apaiser une situation crispante et improductive, tout en permettant la libre e pression, la meilleure solution serait de revendre Fayard, le JDD et Europe 1 au groupe Bolloré, et de permettre ainsi à Louis Hachette Group de renouer avec une réelle neutralité politique bienvenue et attendue». Une prise de parole qui intervient opportunément après une décision de la commission européenne le 18 juillet, selon laquelle Vivendi est accusé d’avoir anticipé sa prise de contrôle de Lagardère. Si les poursuites étaient confirmées , le groupe encourt une amende de 10 % de son chiffre d’affaires. La requête de l’actionnaire de Calmann-Lévy a toutefois été balayée par Arnaud Lagardère, toujours dans le Monde , qui réaffirme que «Fayard, Europe 1 et le JDD sont partie intégrante du groupe Lagardère, ils doivent y rester : leur succès d’audience montre d’ailleurs bien qu’ils ont un rôle à jouer dans la société française». L’offensive de l’héritière fait suite à une campagne menée par des éditeurs indépendants au printemps contre le milliardaire catholique conservateur, avec la parution d’un ouvrage début juin intitulé «Déborder Bolloré» .

Les ventes de LVMH ont reculé de 4 % au premier semestre 2025. (Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters) par Jean-Baptiste Chabran publié le 24 juillet 2025 à 19h10 Le communiqué de presse a beau saluer «des résultats solides», l’ambiance ne doit pas être à la fête du côté de l’avenue Montaigne, siège de LVMH (Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Moët Hennessy). Le français, premier groupe mondial de lu e, a publié ce jeudi 24 juillet ses chiffres du premier semestre 2025. Et ceu -ci sont mauvais : le résultat net (5,7 milliards d’euros) est en chute de 22 % par rapport à l’année dernière. Les ventes, elles, ont reculé de 4 % sur les si premiers mois de l’année, à 39,8 milliards d’euros. «LVMH fait preuve d’une bonne résistance et poursuit sa forte dynamique d’innovation malgré un conte te géopolitique et économique perturbé», euphémise le communiqué. De son côté, le milliardaire Bernard Arnault, PDG du groupe, estime que son entreprise «fait preuve de solidité dans le conte te actuel», tout en disant aborder «la seconde partie de l’année avec une grande vigilance». Mauvaises performances en mode et maroquinerie Ces mauvais chiffres sont en grande partie attribuables au performances de la division mode et maroquinerie. Chez LVMH, cette activité, qui comprend les marques Louis Vuitton et Dior, représentait 48 % du volume des ventes et 78 % des bénéfices en 2024. Au premier semestre de cette année, le chiffre d’affaires de cette division chute de 8 % et les bénéfices de 18 %, laissant entrevoir une baisse significative des marges. Dans le Figaro, ce jeudi soir, Bernard Arnault est donc obligé de faire le SAV pour rassurer tout le monde. Le détenteur de la deu ième fortune de France selon le classement Challenges - il a récemment été dépassé par la famille Hermès - se dit «très optimiste à moyen terme» même si dans l’immédiat, il concède «affronter des vents de face». «Nous avons vécu à plusieurs reprises ces situations par le passé. Elles ne devraient pas durer plus que d’habitude, soit un an et demi ou deu ans», prédit-il. Au début de l’année, LVMH avait déjà annoncé un bénéfice net en baisse de 14 % pour l’année 2024. Son action en Bourse a perdu 26% depuis le 1er janvier. Ralentissement de la demande venue de Chine Le secteur du lu e, dont les trois champions français sont LVMH, Hermès et Kering, connaît une période difficile au niveau mondial. Triomphant après les années Covid, le marché mondial des biens personnels de lu e pèse 363 milliards d’euros. Un chiffre qui a reculé pour la première fois en quinze ans en 2024 (-2 %), hors période de pandémie, selon le cabinet de conseil Bain & Company. En cause, le fort ralentissement de la demande venue de Chine, qui était ces dernières années un moteur, mais aussi l’attentisme du marché au Etats-Unis, suspendu au potentielles décisions sur les droits de douane de Donald Trump. Sur la menace brandie par Trump de les rehausser de 50% sur les produits européens, Bernard Arnault a estimé, toujours dans le Figaro, qu’il était «indispensable» que l’Union européenne trouve «un accord amiable» avec les Etats-Unis: «Nous ne pouvons pas nous permettre de nous brouiller avec les États-Unis.» A La chute des bénéfices de Chanel, illustration d’un secteur du lu e au ralenti Outre ces facteurs très économiques, le lu e doit aussi faire face à d’autres défis. Ces derniers temps, les consommateurs, notamment sur les réseau sociau , questionnent la légitimité des pri et la qualité des produits vendus par les grandes marques. De fait, selon le cabinet McKinsey, entre 2019 et 2023, les grandes marques ont essentiellement tiré leur croissance insolente de l’augmentation démultipliée des pri . Ces critiques ont en partie été alimentées par plusieurs scandales qui ont secoué les prestigieuses maisons Armani, Dior ou plus récemment Valentino (propriété de la famille princière du Qatar) et Loro Piana (LVMH) . A chaque fois, il est reproché au grands groupes d’avoir été négligents et d’avoir permis du travail s’apparentant parfois à de l’esclavage chez leurs sous-traitants italiens.

A l'usine Tesla de Fremont, en Californie, le 10 février 2022. (Josh Eldelson/AFP) par LIBERATION et AFP publié le 24 juillet 2025 à 11h29 (mis à jour le 24 juillet 2025 à 16h11) Tesla continue de s’enfoncer dans la crise . Le constructeur automobile, spécialiste des véhicules électriques, pourrait connaître «quelques trimestres difficiles» d’ici fin 2026. C’est le patron de la marque au logo en forme de T, Elon Musk, qui a sonné l’alerte mercredi 23 juillet, lors d’une conférence en ligne. «Nous nous trouvons dans une phase bizarre de transition où nous allons perdre beaucoup d’avantages au Etats-Unis […] et où nous sommes au prémices de l’autonomie», a souligné le milliardaire, écarté de l’administration Trump début juin. «Le quatrième trimestre 2025, le premier trimestre et le deu ième trimestre 2026» pourraient ainsi être des périodes «difficiles» pour le groupe, a-t-il précisé. Une projection vite confirmée : quelques heures plus tard, le titre Tesla perdait plus de 8% à l’ouverture de Wall Street. Vers 13h50 GMT (15h50 heure de Paris), l’action Tesla lâchait 8,22% à 305,23 dollars. Musk a en outre assuré qu’une fois l’autonomie «déployée à grande échelle au second semestre» 2026, la situation s’améliorerait. Tesla doit en effet négocier un virage crucial lié à la conduite autonome et à l’intelligence artificielle. Sur ce point, l’entreprise a évoqué mercredi dans un communiqué une «accélération au fil du temps des revenus générés par l’IA, les logiciels et liés au flottes». Selon les analystes de Wedbush, une société de conseil bancaire, l’autonomie représente environ à elle seule 1 000 milliards de dollars de valorisation pour l’entreprise implantée à Austin, au Te as. Tesla a déjà lancé un service de ta i sans conducteur – robot-ta i – à Austin en juin, avec quelques Model Y en attendant la production en 2026 de son Cybercab, et prévoit de l’étendre à San Francisco, puis ailleurs (Nevada, Arizona, Floride, etc.). «Pour peu que nous obtenions les feu verts réglementaires, nous pourrions couvrir la moitié de la population américaine d’ici la fin de l’année», a relevé l’homme le plus riche du monde. Un chiffre d’affaires en recul de 12 % sur un an D’ici là, le groupe va s’employer à redresser ses ventes mondiales de véhicules qui ont baissé au deu ième trimestre (-13,5 % sur un an), pour le second trimestre consécutif, selon des chiffres publiés début juillet. Il souffre notamment d’un manque de renouvellement de sa gamme, d’une concurrence accrue notamment en Chine – marché très important pour Tesla –, de l’implication d’Elon Musk dans la sphère politique américaine ou encore d’un ralentissement du marché des véhicules électriques. La suppression du crédit d’impôt de 7 500 dollars au Etats-Unis pour l’achat d’une voiture électrique, prévue au 30 septembre, devrait stimuler un peu ses ventes d’ici là, mais leur asséner ensuite un coup de frein, anticipent en outre des experts. Lors de la réunion du groupe, les dirigeants ont alors incité les acheteurs potentiels à passer commande avant fin août pour être sûrs d’être livrés d’ici au couperet. CheckNews La carte des voitures Tesla brûlées ou vandalisées dans le monde Conséquence de ce repli des ventes : le chiffre d’affaires a reculé de 12 % sur un an à 22,50 milliards de dollars entre avril et juin et le bénéfice net de 16 % à 1,17 milliard. Dans les échanges électroniques après la fermeture de la Bourse de New York, l’action Tesla chutait également de 4,85 %. Le spectre des surta es douanières Contrairement au engagements pris en avril, aucun objectif annuel n’a été divulgué mercredi car «il est difficile de mesurer les impacts d’un commerce mondial changeant et des politiques budgétaires», a fait savoir le groupe. Selon le directeur financier Vaibhav Taneja, les nouveau droits de douane infligés par Donald Trump au importations du monde entier ont pesé autour de 300 millions de dollars. «Du fait d’une latence entre production et ventes, l’impact total n’apparaîtra que dans les prochains trimestres», a-t-il précisé, pronostiquant une hausse des coûts «à court terme». Par ailleurs, Tesla a commencé en juin à fabriquer les premiers e emplaires d’une automobile à bas coût – très attendue, mais dont aucun détail n’a filtré –, et dont la production à grande échelle devrait débuter au second semestre de l’année. Selon la société de conseil Wedbush, «pour les investisseurs, la grande priorité, ce sont les initiatives en matière d’IA […] et les marchés sont fermement à l’affût de toute indication concernant l’investissement de Tesla dans Ai», startup contrôlée par Elon Musk et qui se veut être un concurrent à l’entreprise OpenAI. A la mi-juillet, l’homme d’affaires avait notamment annoncé qu’un projet d’investissement au capital de AI allait être soumis à l’Assemblée générale de Tesla, le 6 novembre.

Siège de la Banque centrale européenne à Francfort, en Allemagne, le 18 juillet 2024. (Jana Rodenbusch/Reuters) par Ismérie Vergne publié le 24 juillet 2025 à 10h00 (mis à jour le 24 juillet 2025 à 14h24) Après huit baisses de son tau directeur en un an, la Banque centrale européenne (BCE) décide de lever le pied, ce jeudi 24 juillet, à l’occasion de sa conférence sur la politique monétaire dans la zone euro. Lors de sa dernière baisse de tau , le 5 juin, la présidente de la BCE, Christine Lagarde, avait estimé «qu’au niveau actuel des tau d’intérêt» , l’institution financière était arrivée «à la fin d’un cycle de politique monétaire». L’institution de Francfort stabilise ainsi son tau directeur à 2 %, après une chute progressive de son tau de dépôt de 4 % à 2 % entre juin 2024 et juin 2025. Ce statu quo monétaire est principalement motivé par la maîtrise de l’inflation. Cette dernière est rentrée dans les clous avec un tau annuel dans la zone euro établi à 2 % en juin 2025 contre 2,5 % un an auparavant, d’après les données publiées par Eurostat. Christine Lagarde n’a pas manqué de souligner que «l’économie a, jusqu’à présent, globalement bien résisté dans un conte te mondial difficile» même si «l’environnement reste e trêmement incertain, en particulier en raison des tensions commerciales». La baisse du tau directeur visait jusque-là à soutenir l’économie de la zone euro menacée par l’incertitude géopolitique et les tensions commerciales avec les Etats-Unis. Mi-juillet, Donald Trump a acté, faute d’accord commercial avec l’Union européenne d’ici au 1er août, 30 % de droits de douane supplémentaires sur l’ensemble des biens européens e portés au Etats-Unis. Sur certains secteurs clés, cette surta e douanière porte, au nom de la «sécurité nationale», les droits de douane à 55 % pour les voitures et les produits pharmaceutiques, et à 80 % pour l’acier et l’aluminium. Mercredi 23 juillet, des diplomates cités par Bloomberg e pliquaient malgré tout que les négociations s’orientaient vers une hausse limitée à 15 %. Dans l’attente de voir les négociations aboutir entre l’UE et les Etats-Unis, la baisse du tau directeur permettait d’anticiper la détérioration des prévisions de croissance du PIB de la zone euro. Fin mai, la Commission a abaissé ces dernières à 1,1 % en 2025, contre 1,5 % dans ses projections de novembre. La présidente de la BCE souhaite une issue «rapide» au incertitudes commerciales, l’institution monétaire se trouvant dans une «situation d’attente» . Envolée de l’euro Autre incertitude, l’envolée de la devise européenne face au dollar que Christine Lagarde dit «surveiller» en raison de «son importance sur les prévisions d’inflation» . Depuis le début de l’année 2025, la monnaie unique a progressé de près de 15 % par rapport à la devise américaine, le billet vert étant plombé par l’inconstance de la politique de l’administration Trump. C’est pourquoi le président américain juge les tau d’intérêt fi és par la Réserve fédérale américaine (Fed) trop élevés. En juin, elle a maintenu, pour la quatrième fois consécutive, ses tau dans une fourchette comprise entre 4,25 % et 4,5 %. Depuis plusieurs mois, Trump en vient à s’en prendre directement au dirigeant de la Fed, Jerome Powell , – qu’il a lui-même nommé en 2018 – au point de menacer de le limoger. Cette appréciation de la monnaie fait perdre en compétitivité la zone euro pour ses e portations, mais, à l’inverse, fait baisser le coût des importations et permet ainsi de freiner l’inflation. «Dans l’ensemble, la BCE adopte donc clairement une posture attentiste. Une baisse en septembre [lors de la prochaine réunion] reste envisageable, mais le calendrier fait débat. Après huit baisses de tau en un an, les tau ne sont plus restrictifs, mais simplement «neutres» – aller plus loin nécessitera sans doute des signes plus nets de ralentissement» , a commenté Madison Faller de J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Mises à jour à 15h40 avec la confirmation du maintien du tau directeur puis les déclarations de Christine Lagarde et les réactions.

Mathieu Pigasse, à Paris, le 7 janvier 2025. (Cyril Zannettacci/Vu pour Libération) par Franck Bouaziz publié le 24 juillet 2025 à 13h03 Les festivals de musique deviennent des manifestations visiblement de plus en plus convoitées. L’un de ceu qui ouvrent la saison en région parisienne , We Love Green vient de changer de propriétaire. Il est repris, à hauteur de 80 %, par un duo composé de Matthieu Pigasse banquier d’affaires et entrepreneur de médias à travers le groupe Combat ( les Inrocks, Radio Nova, une participation dans la société de production Mediawan) associé au producteur américain de spectacles AEG Presents. «Identité éditoriale» Créé il y a une dizaine d’années, cet événement qui se déroule sur trois jours en juin au bois de Vincennes (Paris IIe) rassemble spectateurs. Comme son nom l’indique, il affiche une certaine sensibilité sur les questions environnementales et ouvre des espaces de discussion sur ces thèmes entre deu concerts. «Nous investissons massivement dans les festivals et nous les considérons comme une alternative au concerts dans les stades ou les Arenas», indique à Libération Matthieu Pigasse, qui entend donner une «identité éditoriale» à ce festival. We Love Green vient s’ajouter pour le groupe Combat à un autre événement qui boucle l’été et se situe dans l’ouest parisien : Rock en Seine dont il est propriétaire. Il détient également le Golden Coast dédié au rap à Dijon (Côte-d’Or) et est partenaire de La Route du Rock à Saint-Malo (Ille-et-Vilaine). Limonade Il semble que l’on assiste à un mouvement de consolidation sur le marché de ces événements musicau , à l’image de ce qui s’est déjà réalisé chez les producteurs de spectacles où nombre d’indépendants ont été rachetés par de grosses structures. Une manière de répondre à l’augmentation des cachets demandés par les artistes, mais aussi des coûts de sécurité ou de la billetterie de plus en plus sécurisée. Dans le même temps, les collectivités locales qui par le passé ont largement subventionné ces manifestations, ont opéré un repli pour des raisons budgétaires. Outre les recettes tirées de la billetterie, les organisateurs doivent donc maintenant doper les revenus venus du sponsoring ou de la restauration sur place. Ce que l’on appelle dans le jargon du métier : la limonade.

Mais il a maintenu ses objectifs de production dans les hydrocarbures comme dans l’électricité. TotalEnergies a été pénalisé au 2e trimestre par la baisse des cours du pétrole et du gaz. (Matthias Balk/PictureAlliance / Icon Sport) par LIBERATION et AFP publié le 24 juillet 2025 à 10h37 TotalEnergies s’y était préparé. Le bénéfice net du groupe pétro-gazier a chuté de 29 % au 2e trimestre, à 2,7 milliards de dollars, pénalisé par la baisse des cours du pétrole et du gaz. Mais le groupe a maintenu ses objectifs de production dans les hydrocarbures comme dans l’électricité. TotalEnergies avait préparé les esprits : dans une note d’indicateurs avant ses résultats, il avait prévenu que la baisse des cours devrait peser sur les résultats de sa branche reine de l’E ploration-Production. Sur un an, son chiffre d’affaires a reculé de 7,6 % à 49,6 milliards de dollars au 2e trimestre. Le groupe fait valoir qu’en dépit d’ «un pri du brut en baisse de 10 %», ses flu de trésorerie [cash flow, ndlr] ont diminué «de seulement 5 %» notamment «grâce à la croissance de sa production d’hydrocarbures» au 2e trimestre. Cours du pétrole Les marchés pétroliers ont connu des derniers mois fébriles entre l’incertitude sur la situation économique mondiale avec la guerre commerciale lancée par l’administration Trump à coûts de hausse de droits de douane, l’escalade des tensions au Moyen-Orient et la réouverture des vannes de la production de l’Opep + pour doper une demande atone. Le brent s’est effondré à 67,9 dollars le baril en moyenne au 2e trimestre, contre 85 dollars un an plus tôt. A cela s’ajoute le recul des cours et une moindre volatilité sur le marché mondial du gaz liquéfié, devenu indispensable à bien des pays depuis la guerre en Ukraine, qui ont rogné les marges de l’entreprise dans ses activités de négoce. Tribune Faut-il démanteler TotalEnergies ? Pour autant, TotalEnergies estime avoir «poursuivi avec succès l’e écution de sa stratégie multi-énergies équilibrée, s’appuyant sur une croissance soutenue de sa production d’hydrocarbures et d’électricité». Sa production de pétrole a augmenté «de plus de 3 % sur un an» grâce au démarrage du champ de Ballymore, au Etats-Unis, dans le golfe du Me ique, ainsi que de celui de Mero-4, au Brésil, avec un trimestre d’avance. La hausse est conforme au objectifs du groupe qui avait prévu une croissance de sa production d’hydrocarbures d’environ 3 % par an jusqu’en 2030 et même au-dessus de 3 % en 2025 et 2026, contre une augmentation de 2 % à 3 % par an jusqu’en 2028 prévue auparavant. Electricité plus rentable Sous le feu des critiques pour ses investissements continus dans les énergies fossiles, le groupe répète que le pétrole et le gaz sont encore nécessaires pour répondre à la demande d’énergie mondiale, notamment des pays émergents et financer les investissements dans les renouvelables. Et ce alors qu’un avis inédit de la Cour internationale de justice , instance de l’ONU, a estimé mercredi que le fait pour un pays de ne pas prendre des mesures pour combattre le changement climatique en réduisant la production et la consommation d’énergies fossiles peut constituer un fait «illicite» . Au milieu des revirements sur la transition énergétique annoncés par ses concurrentes européennes Shell et BP, le groupe s’emploie lui à se démarquer en montrant qu’il est «devenu la société la plus engagée dans la transition énergétique parmi les majors» et qu’il «maintient le cap» dans les renouvelables, une activité de plus en plus rentable. Il compte atteindre une rentabilité sur capitau investis de 12 % dans l’électricité - contre 10 % aujourd’hui - autant que pour le pétrole et le gaz sur la base d’un baril de brut à 60 dollars. Au 2e trimestre, le cap de 100 GW de capacité brute d’électricité en production a été dépassé, en construction ou en développement avancé, avec ses projets dans le solaire, l’éolien et le stockage par batteries. Ces investissements doivent lui permettre d’atteindre en TWh de production électrique, de quoi couvrir autant que ce que consomme les Pays-Bas. Cette électricité sera produite à 70 % à partir d’éolien ou de solaire et à 30 % à partir d’actifs «fle ibles» tels que les centrales à gaz, une énergie fossile que le groupe met en avant pour compenser l’intermittence des renouvelables en l’absence de soleil et de vent. Sur le semestre, sa production d’électricité a atteint 23 TWh, en hausse de plus de 20 % sur un an.

L’idée fait autant hurler les chefs d’entreprise que les syndicats, convaincus que la mesure sera «contreproductive». Actuellement, dans le privé, les salariés ont trois jours de carence – c’est-à-dire sans versement d’indemnité en cas d’arrêt maladie – contre un jour pour les fonctionnaires. (Laure Boyer /Hans Lucas. AFP) par Margo Magny publié le 23 juillet 2025 à 20h00 Depuis l’année dernière, une petite musique revient régulièrement : selon le gouvernement, le nombre d’arrêts maladie partirait à la «dérive». Les fraudes au indemnités journalières ont représenté 42 millions d’euros en 2024 selon l’Assurance maladie. Plus de deu fois ce qu’elles représentaient en 2023. Lors de l’e amen du projet de loi de financement de la sécurité sociale 2025, le directeur de l’ Assurance maladie , Thomas Fatôme, annonçait vouloir s’attaquer au sujet. Depuis le 1er juillet, de nouveau formulaires papier, plus difficiles à falsifier, sont donc devenus obligatoires pour tenter d’enrayer le phénomène.

A la Bourse de New York, le 11 juillet. (Timothy A. Clary /AFP) par LIBERATION , AFP et Reuters publié le 23 juillet 2025 à 19h52 Le caractère imprévisible de Donald Trump, auquel il reviendra de valider l’accord final, invite à la prudence. Mais les sources diplomatiques évoquées par Reuters et Bloomberg, ce mercredi 23 juillet, se disent optimistes quant à une issue imminente des négociations sur les droits de douane qui ont lieu entre les Etats-Unis et l’Union européenne. Les Etats membres seraient prêts à accepter des droits de douane à 15 % sur la plupart des produits, et les fonctionnaires de l’UE insistent pour que ce droit couvre aussi des secteurs tels que l’automobile, ont indiqué les diplomates. Les importations d’acier et d’aluminium dépassant un certain quota seraient pour leur part soumises à des droits de douane de 50 %, selon les mêmes sources. Droits de douane de Trump : pourquoi l’Italie, l’Allemagne, la France ou l’Irlande ont plus à perdre que les autres pays européens A une semaine de l’échéance, l’UE s’efforce d’arracher un accord avec les Américains, et les négociations ressemblent à des montagnes russes. Donald Trump a pris les Européens de court le 12 juillet en décrétant des droits de douane de 30 % sur toutes les importations en provenance de l’UE à compter du 1er août. L’Europe a encore l’espoir de trouver une solution négociée, mais a listé des biens américains à ta er à partir du 7 août en cas d’échec des discussions, d’une valeur totale de près de 100 milliards d’euros. Rejet d’un premier projet d’accord Dépêché par Bru elles pour négocier avec les Américains, le commissaire européen au Commerce, Maros Sefcovic, s’est rendu plusieurs fois à Washington et échange régulièrement avec Howard Lutnick et Jamieson Greer, ses homologues au sein de l’administration Trump. Il devait encore s’entretenir mercredi après-midi avec Howard Lutnick. Donald Trump et la cheffe de l’e écutif européen, Ursula von der Leyen, ont eu quant à eu des contacts plus sporadiques, dont un échange téléphonique le 6 juillet. Droits de douane américains, dernière ligne droite avant le verdict Les responsables européens espéraient initialement conclure un accord maintenant une ta e de base de 10 % sur les produits européens, avec des e emptions pour des secteurs stratégiques comme l’aéronautique. Mais Trump a rejeté le projet d’accord, et les négociateurs américains proposent maintenant une ta e de base de 15 %, selon des sources européennes. Les droits de douane moyens, des deu côtés de l’Atlantique, s’établissaient à environ 1 % avant le retour de Donald Trump à la Maison Blanche en janvier, selon Bru elles. Trump veut que l’Europe achète plus de gaz naturel américain Peu de détails ont fuité des discussions. Trump martèle qu’il veut éliminer le déficit commercial des Etats-Unis avec l’UE dans l’échange de biens. Il pousse notamment le Vieu Continent à acheter davantage de gaz naturel liquéfié (GNL) américain. Son équipe s’en prend aussi régulièrement au barrières dites «non tarifaires» en vigueur dans l’UE : les réglementations sanitaires, les normes environnementales, des politiques de tau de change ou des mesures fiscales telles que la TVA. Bru elles refuse catégoriquement d’abandonner certaines de ces mesures. Tout comme ses puissantes lois sur le numérique, régulièrement critiquées par les géants de la tech. «Tout est tellement cher» : les Américains payent le pri fort des droits de douane L’UE veut à tout pri faire baisser la température et éviter des droits de douane L qui nuiraient à son économie, déjà enlisée dans une quasi-stagnation depuis fin 2022. Bru elles avait proposé une e emption de droits de douane totale et réciproque pour les produits industriels, dont les voitures. Mais Trump jugeait cette offre insuffisante. «Bazooka» L’UE prépare parallèlement des mesures de riposte au cas où les négociations n’aboutiraient pas. Elle affirme être prête à ta er pour quelque 100 milliards d’euros de biens américains : avions, voitures, bourbon… L’UE envisage aussi de cibler les services américains, y compris la tech et les services financiers. En cas d’échec des négociations, l’unité des Européens sera mise à l’épreuve. La France pousse Bru elles à adopter une position ferme, jusqu’à déployer son outil commercial le plus puissant, «l’instrument anti-coercition» , si les négociations avec les Etats-Unis échouent. Surnommé «bazooka» , cet outil a été pensé comme un instrument de dissuasion à activer après épuisement des voies diplomatiques. Il permettrait notamment le gel de l’accès au marchés publics européens ou le blocage de certains investissements, mais nécessite plusieurs mois pour entrer en vigueur. D’autres pays comme l’Irlande, dont l’économie est très dépendante des investissements américains, plaident au contraire pour éviter une telle confrontation.

Laronce, D. Deparnay, F. Bellouti, N. Jauson. Édité par l'agence 6médias France Télévisions Sur les pas de l'aventurier Louis Blériot, Franky Zapata va tenter de rejoindre l'Angleterre avec son AirScooter au départ de Sangatte, vendredi 25 juillet. Si ans plus tôt, il survolait la mer avec un Flyboard, l'une de ses premières inventions. Ce te te correspond à une partie de la retranscription du reportage ci-dessus. Cliquez sur la v idéo pour la regarder en intégralité. Les derniers réglages ont eu lieu dans la matinée du vendredi 25 juillet. L'invention de celui que l'on surnomme \"l'homme volant\" ressemble à un gros insecte venu du futur. Franky Zapata veut marquer l'histoire de l'aviation. À bord de ce petit bijou de technologie, l'Air Scooter, un ta i volant biplace, il va tenter de voler jusqu'en Angleterre. \" Je suis passionné d'aviation depuis que je suis tout petit. Malheureusement, je n'ai pas pu être pilote d'hélicoptère, parce que je suis daltonien. Mais j'ai été bercé par tous les récits des pionniers de l'aviation. Aujourd'hui, à notre humble échelle, on n'essaie pas de marcher dans leurs traces, on essaie de laisser des petits pas de fourmis dans les gigantesques traces que ces pionniers ont laissées\" , confie-t-il. Il n'a pas choisi Sangatte (Pas-de-Calais) par hasard. C'est d'ici que le pionnier de l'aviation, Louis Blériot, a réalisé la première traversée de la Manche, le 25 juillet 1909. De défis en défis Depuis si ans, Franky Zapata, ancien champion du monde de jet-ski, donne le vertige au Français. Au défilé du 14 juillet 2019, casqué et harnaché, il décollait à la verticale sur les Champs-Élysées. Avec son Flyboard, une planche turbo propulsée, le Marseillais a aussi traversé la Manche en une vingtaine de minutes. Ce vendredi matin à Sangatte, l'Air Scooter, 115 kg, deu heures d'autonomie et propulsion hybride, était fin prêt pour le nouveau défi. \" Tout le monde est à fond, tout le monde essaye de faire de son mieu pour que tout se passe bien \", s'est réjouit l'inventeur. Franky Zapata vise d'ores et déjà le marché américain : dès 2026, son Air Scooter proposera des vols touristiques à Las Vegas. les mots-clés associés à cet article Aéronautique Éco / Conso France Lancez la conversation",

Deschateau , J. Esposito, A. Guin, V. Bouffartigue, M. Male, L. Latour. Édité par l'agence 6médias France Télévisions Les 10 à 15 millions de contribuables qui ont payé trop d'impôts recevrons prochainement un remboursement par virement sur leur compte bancaire.

Ce te te correspond à une partie de la retranscription du reportage ci-dessus. Cliquez sur la v idéo pour la regarder en intégralité. Comme chaque été, l'administration fiscale va rembourser une partie des impôts des Français qui ont été trop prélevés en 2024. Une bonne surprise pour un père de famille. \" J'avais oublié de déclarer une situation. J'ai régularisé ma situation et donc j'ai un rattrapage mais en ma faveur, et c'est plutôt une bonne nouvelle\" , confie-t-il. Sont concernés les foyers ayant changé de composition, avec la naissance d'un enfant par e emple. \" Cette année, c'est plutôt chouette parce que là, c'est 2 000 et quelques. C'est très appréciable, ça va financer les vacances, c'est très bien\", se réjouit un père de famille concerné. Isabelle est aujourd'hui à la retraite, et son niveau de revenu a baissé. Elle sera donc remboursée, elle aussi, le 25 juillet ou le 1er août. \" Quand vous travaillez et vous êtes à la retraite par la suite, vous avez des entrées moins importantes, donc forcément, ils restituent un certain montant\", dit-elle. Ajuster son tau en ligne Seront également remboursés les Français ayant un crédit d'impôt pour des aides à domicile ou de la garde d'enfants, par e emple. À l'inverse, si les revenus ont augmenté, il faudra payer une somme supplémentaire, qui sera prélevée à partir du mois de septembre. Pour éviter les mauvaises surprises, il est possible d'ajuster son tau de prélèvement à la source sur le site internet, en anticipant les changements. \" Il n'y a pas de calendrier particulier pour changer le tau de prélèvement. Vous pouvez le faire à tout moment. La seule chose à savoir, c'est qu'il y a toujours un peu de délai entre le moment où vous le changez et le moment où votre employeur est au courant et applique ce changement\" , e plique Ma ime Chipoy, président de MoneyVo .

L'immeuble en question a été mis sous surveillance jusqu'à la réalisation des travau à cause de parties communes insalubres et de compteurs électriques. Une première en France.

(JULIEN MATTIA / LE PICTORIUM / MA PPP) Devant la tour Eiffel, Myra et Romy, deu Allemandes avec une glace à la main, enchaînent les selfies. À la télé pendant les JO , cette tour Eiffel leur semblait plus petite. \"Quand on est sorties du métro et qu'on l'a vue, on s'est dit 'waouh, elle est si impressionnante !' \", sourit l'une d'elles. \" Paris est une ville incroyable. J'ai regardé la cérémonie d'ouverture l'an dernier et quand vous voyez ça à la télé, ça vous donne forcément envie de venir. C'est fou que Céline Dion a chanté ici ! \", s'enthousiasme l'autre. : à REPORTAGE. Entre équipements modernes et grosses déceptions, que reste-t-il des Jeu olympiques en Seine-Saint-Denis un an après ? Un peu plus bas, une trentaine de touristes venues du monde entier fait la queue devant les anneau olympiques. Parmi eu : la famille de Christian, venue d'Italie. \" On est une famille très sportive, on voulait voir ce symbole des jeu . On a regardé le basket, l'athlétisme, la natation dans la Seine... C'était dingue ! Alors, pour les vacances, on a voulu emmener nos enfants ici \", raconte le père de famille. \"Une année record\" Et visiblement, ils ne sont pas les seuls à avoir eu cette idée : tout autour, dans les rues du centre de Paris, les hôtels sont complets. \"Il y a quand même beaucoup plus de monde que l'année dernière. Le mois de juillet est vraiment très rempli. Il y a eu un mois de juin record pour nous. Effectivement, on est sur une année record \", glisse Armand, chef de réception de l'un des établissements hôteliers de la zone. Davantage de clients donc, mais attention, ce ne sont pas seulement des fans nostalgiques des Jeu olympiques de Paris. Il faut ajouter tous ceu qui ont reporté leur voyage l'an dernier à cause de l'évènement. \" Forcément, ça a dissuadé des gens de venir en se disant que ça allait être très cher , poursuit Armand. \"On revient à une année classique au niveau du type de nationalités. C'est-à-dire qu'il y a autant d'Américains, de Coréens qu'avant, ainsi qu'une clientèle d'Arabie saoudite, des Émirats, etc., qui reviennent, alors qu'ils avaient clairement déserté l'année dernière.\" Armand, chef de réception d'un hôtel du centre de Paris à Franceinfo Paris accueille bien deu types de clientèle cet été, résume Véronique Sigel, présidente hôtellerie de l'Union des métiers et des industries hôtellerie (Umih). Dans les deu cas, il y a un \"effet JO\", direct ou indirect. \" On s'en rend compte puisque les autres destinations françaises sont globalement plutôt à la traîne. Et que, contrairement au autres régions françaises, Paris s'en tire bien \", constate-t-elle. De janvier à mai 2025, 19,2 millions de visiteurs - dont 9 millions d'étrangers - ont été accueillis à Paris, soit +1 % par rapport à 2024. Mais s'il n'y avait pas eu ce \" double effet JO \", estime-t-elle, Paris aurait sûrement eu cette année, comme les autres régions, des chiffres touristiques dans le rouge.

Et des yeu rivés sur Waze dans l'espoir que la circulation se débloque. Antoine Courmont, maître de conférences à l’université Gustave-Eiffel et spécialiste des rapports entre urbanisme et data, e plique à franceinfo comment l'algorithme de Waze fonctionne, nous redirige et a des conséquences sur le quotidien des petites communes. Voir cette publication sur Instagram Une publication partagée par franceinfo  Waze est une application de navigation qui a pour particularité de se baser sur les données en temps réel de ses utilisateurs. Et comme le rappelle Antoine Courmont, le nombre fait la force : \"Waze, c'est entre 15 et 20 millions d'utilisateurs en France. Avec à peu près 40 millions d'automobilistes en France, c'est quasiment un sur deu qui l'utilise.\" Ce qui rend Waze \"assez précis sur les temps de trajet, puisque c'est un calcul sur le parcours en temps réel et aussi historique des automobilistes.\" Quand il y a des embouteillages, de nouveau itinéraires sont proposés au utilisateurs. Mais ces nouveau trajets sont-ils proposés à tous les automobilistes d'un même endroit, ou y a-t-il une sélection pour mieu fluidifier la circulation ? \"Peut-être que Waze n'envoie pas tout le monde vers le même itinéraire pour éviter de créer des bouchons ailleurs\", s'interroge aussi le chercheur. Pas de réponse de la part de Waze, que nous avons sollicité plusieurs fois sur ce point. L'impact de Waze sur les petites communes Ces itinéraires bis ont un impact important pour les communes proches des autoroutes. Une armée d'automobilistes surgit alors sur des petites routes communales ou départementales. \"Cela crée des nuisances, des problèmes de sécurité \", e plique Antoine Courmont, \"mais aussi, des problèmes de maintenance puisque vous faites passer beaucoup de véhicules sur des routes où le revêtement n'est pas adapté.\" L'application de navigation Waze (THOMAS SELLIN / FRANCEINFO) Les élus de ces communes se mobilisent face à ces problématiques. Waze se retranche derrière \"la neutralité de l'algorithme\", qui se contente de proposer une voie ouverte à ses utilisateurs. Il y a bien des alternatives à mettre en place, comme \"restreindre la vitesse de circulation en rajoutant des dos d'ânes, des feu pénalisants ou des voies à sens unique\" . Mais ces dispositifs ont leurs limites, et le problème se déporte alors sur les communes voisines. Un décret annulé par le Conseil d'Etat Pour lutter contre ces nuisances, et aussi éviter de changer constamment d'itinéraire, un décret a été publié en août 2022 . Pour Antoine Courmont, cette mesure concerne directement Waze : \"Elle oblige les calculateurs d'itinéraires à privilégier la voie principale si on gagne moins de 10% de temps de trajet avec un autre chemin.\" Ce décret a finalement été annulé un an plus tard par le Conseil d'État. En effet, toute mesure qui a un impact sur l’environnement doit faire l’objet d’une consultation publique. L'occasion, peut-être, d'envisager différemment les départs en vacances. \"On peut voyager autrement avec plus de découvertes, plus d'inconnu, moins de dépenses sans prendre l'autoroute. Peut-être que les vacances, ça peut être le moment de ne pas être dans la recherche d'efficience à tout pri \", conclut l'enseignant-chercheur. les mots-clés associés à cet article Automobile Éco / Conso Lancez la conversation",

Revidon - Édité par l'agence 6médias France Télévisions JT de 8h Édition du vendredi 25 juillet 2025 Le gouvernement s'apprête à prendre de nouvelles mesures pour réduire les dépenses du compte personnel de formation (CPF). Ce qui pourrait rapporter millions d'euros d'économie à l'état. Le CPF, de nouveau dans le viseur du gouvernement. Trop coûteu , selon le ministère du Travail, qui entend plafonner les achats de formation. À la clé, jusqu'à 250 millions d'euros d'économies par an, selon nos confrères des Échos. La cotisation versée par les entreprises ne couvre pas tous les achats de formation, obligeant l'État à combler la différence. Plafonner la prise en charge du CPF Parmi les plus onéreu , le bilan de compétences, très prisé des titulaires d'un CPF. Mais la qualité des prestations vendues reste difficile à contrôler. \" Tout le monde peut en faire sans aucun contrôle sur le profil, l'e périence ou le diplôme. C'est le problème \", e plique Bérénice Le Pêcheur, président de la fédération française des professionnels de l'accompagnement et du bilan de compétences. Pour trier les prestataires, le gouvernement envisagerait notamment d'imposer un cahier des charges national, de plafonner la prise en charge du CPF à 1 700 euros ou encore de limiter à un achat tous les cinq ans. En 2024, près de personnes ont entamé une formation grâce au CPF .

(BASTIEN OHIER / HANS LUCAS / AFP) Si les défenseurs de la loi saluent un moyen de relancer l'appareil de production agricole français, ses opposants y voient de quoi favoriser \"un modèle agro-industriel\". Elle vise à réintroduire l'acétamipride , un pesticide interdit en France depuis 2018, faciliter l'agrandissement ou la création de bâtiments d'élevage intensif ou encore le stockage de l'eau pour l'irrigation des cultures. Définitivement adoptée le 8 juillet , la loi Duplomb, du nom du sénateur LR portant le te te, était destinée à \"lever les contraintes à l'e ercice du métier d'agriculteur\". Mais elle déclenche ces derniers jours des débats enflammés. Sur le site de l'Assemblée nationale, une pétition critiquant son impact sur l'environnement et la santé approchait les 2 millions de signataires, vendredi 25 juillet. D'un côté, ses défenseurs saluent l'adoption de la loi. La FNSEA , premier syndicat agricole, et ses alliés des Jeunes Agriculteurs évoquent \"un premier pas pour relancer notre appareil [français] de production agricole\" . De l'autre, de nombreuses voi déplorent un moyen de favoriser \"un modèle agro-industriel qui ne répond en rien au attentes du monde paysan\" , selon les mots de la Confédération paysanne, troisième syndicat agricole du pays. En somme, l'illustration d'un clivage entre deu visions opposées de l'agriculture. Une loi qui permet de réduire notre dépendance, selon ses défenseurs \"La réalité de ce que demande l'écologie, c'est la fin de l'agriculture française , assénait dimanche sur franceinfo Laurent Duplomb. Moins nous produirons en France, plus nous serons soumis à acheter des produits qui viennent d'ailleurs et qui ne correspondent pas du tout à nos normes.\" Le sénateur, ancien président de la chambre d'agriculture de la Haute-Loire, se fait ainsi le porte-voi de la FNSEA , le te te reprenant \"plusieurs revendications anciennes du syndicat majoritaire agricole, historiquement opposé à la réduction de l'utilisation de pesticides\" , analyse sur le site The Conversation le chercheur Ale is Aulagnier. Sans ce te te de loi, \"moins de production, plus de dépendance, une perte de compétitivité face à des agricultures moins-disantes\" , résume le patron de la FNSEA, Arnaud Rousseau, sur . Pour le syndicat , cette loi \"dénonce une vision restrictive de l'écologie sacrifiant les agriculteurs sur l'autel de l'idéologie\" . Que répond-on en face ? Les opposants à la loi y voient \"la vision datée d'un modèle agricole productiviste qui sacrifie la durabilité à la performance immédiate et sans avenir\" , selon les mots du réseau des Centres d'initiatives pour valoriser l'agriculture et le milieu rural (Civam). Ou encore \"un modèle agricole destructeur de l'environnement et dangereu pour la santé\" , selon le mouvement Terre de liens . \"Notre association demande au président de la République de ne pas promulguer la loi Duplomb, qui va à l'encontre des principes de précaution et de promotion d'un modèle agricole durable\" , embraye l'association Générations futures . \"Oui, il est possible de réduire le caractère intensif\" A ce modèle qu'ils pointent unanimement du doigt, ils opposent les nombreuses pratiques agroécologiques : agriculture biologique, agroforesterie, diversification des cultures, pâturage dans les vergers, biocontrôle – qui permet de réguler les maladies et ravageurs en utilisant leurs prédateurs naturels –, implantation de haies, paillage, association de cultures, pastoralisme, rotation annuelle des cultures, selon une liste non e haustive de l'Institut national de recherche pour l'agriculture, l'alimentation et l'environnement (Inrae) . \"Ces types d'agricultures ont un point commun : réduire les conséquences indésirables et travailler avec la nature plutôt que contre elle\" , définit Vincent Bretagnolle, chercheur CNRS au Centre d'études biologiques de Chizé. Ces systèmes réduisent aussi \"la consommation d'énergie, d'eau, d'engrais, de produits phytopharmaceutiques et de médicaments vétérinaires\" , selon les termes définis par la loi du 13 octobre 2014 . De quoi améliorer la qualité des sols et de l'eau et capturer du carbone, tout en \"accroissant la productivité\" , dépeint le rapport de l'IPBES , le groupe de scientifiques spécialistes de la biodiversité sous l'égide de l'ONU. Des pratiques déjà e périmentées en France. \"Au 1er juillet 2024, 39 772 e ploitations agricoles [étaient] certifiées haute valeur environnementale\" , selon le ministère , et plus de 60 000 e ploitations étaient engagées dans une démarche de production biologique, d'après l'Agence bio . \"Oui, il est possible de réduire le caractère intensif et de faire sans glyphosate et sans néonicotinoïdes. On l'e périmente et ça ne nuit pas au rendements, ou de manière marginale\" , assure Vincent Bretagnolle, qui anime depuis trente-deu ans une zone d'e périmentation de nouvelles pratiques agroécologiques dans le Centre-Ouest. \"Quand on réduit l'usage de l'agrochimie, ça réduit les charges des agriculteurs.\" Ces alternatives ont émergé dès les années 1960, retrace l'Inrae . Mais elles ne représentent aujourd'hui \"que 10%\" environ des agriculteurs, selon Vincent Bretagnolle. \"La loi Duplomb favorise plutôt une minorité\" d'agriculteurs En face, on retrouve donc le modèle plus intensif, aussi appelé \"productiviste\", soit une agriculture qui cherche un rendement élevé, avec, notamment, un recours important au intrants chimiques. \"La filière alimentaire doit poursuivre une double ambition, celle de continuer à répondre au besoins alimentaires des Français et de contribuer à nourrir le monde\" , définit aussi la FNSEA dans son pacte productif pour 2025 . \"C'est le modèle dominant, soit environ 90% des agriculteurs en système de grande culture\" , constate Vincent Bretagnolle. Et la tendance va dans le sens de l'agrandissement des e ploitations : \"En 2020, la surface d'une e ploitation en France est de 69 hectares en moyenne, contre 55 en 2010\" , note l'Insee , qui précise qu'un quart des e ploitations les plus grandes condensent 68% de la surface agricole française. Cette vision de l'agriculture entraîne avec elle de nombreuses pollutions de l'eau et des sols ainsi que des dégradations de l'environnement. Les activités agricoles sont aussi l'une des premières causes de l'effondrement de la biodiversité au niveau mondial. \"La mécanisation a supprimé 70% du linéaire des haies bocagères depuis 1950, ce qui porte préjudice à la biodiversité. Depuis 1990, la surface des prairies a diminué de 11%, et depuis 1989, 36% de la population d'oiseau des milieu agricoles a disparu\" , illustre l'Insee. Mais pour les chercheurs, les débats actuels, concentrés sur ces deu visions, sont réducteurs. \"La loi Duplomb favorise plutôt une minorité au sein de ces 90% , analyse Vincent Bretagnolle. Ceu qui sont dans des modèles très productivistes, tournés à presque 100% vers l'e portation, dont le modèle économique repose sur de très grandes superficies, une très grande mécanisation et beaucoup d'intrants.\" Une lecture que partage Ale is Aulagnier, sur The Conversation : \"La loi Duplomb était censée être une réponse législative au malaises agricoles. Elle comprend en réalité des mesures techniques qui ne concernent qu'un nombre réduit d'e ploitants, en particulier ceu qui possèdent les e ploitations à l'orientation la plus intensive.\" Une indispensable adaptation face au réchauffement climatique Face à ce débat, une réalité s'impose pourtant : dans un conte te de réchauffement climatique et d'effondrement de la biodiversité, l'agriculture est forcée de s'adapter et de se transformer. Premières victimes , les agriculteurs ont en effet vu leurs rendements diminuer , leurs vendanges avancer , leurs terres s'assécher et de nouvelles maladies fragiliser leurs élevages. Pour Vincent Bretagnolle, \"le modèle productiviste n'est pas viable sur le long terme\" , puisqu' \"il n'y a pas de production sans écosystèmes et biodiversité\" . Selon les chercheurs, la transition est donc la seule solution. \"L'adaptation au changement climatique et la restauration des services écosystémiques sont indispensables pour assurer la performance productive et économique. Le déploiement de l'agroécologie est considéré comme la voie la plus pertinente en Europe pour y parvenir\" , juge en effet Christian Huyghe, directeur scientifique Agriculture à l'Inrae. Quand le Giec prévient dans son dernier rapport que \"certaines zones actuellement consacrées à l'agriculture et à l'élevage deviendront climatiquement inadaptées\" – jusqu'à 10% à l'échelle mondiale d'ici à 2050, et plus de 30% d'ici à 2100 dans le pire des scénarios d'émissions de gaz à effet de serre –, \"il est impossible de prévoir combien de temps ce modèle va perdurer, mais il faut travailler sur celui de demain , e horte Vincent Bretagnolle.

(France 2) 8min Article rédigé par France 2 - Édité par l'agence 6médias France Télévisions Nathalie Delattre, ministre déléguée au tourisme, était l’invitée des \"4V\" de France 2, vendredi 25 juillet. Elle est notamment revenue sur la reconnaissance de l'État de Palestine annoncée par Emmanuel Macron, les mesures de François Bayrou pour booster le tourisme ou encore les déclarations de Bruno Retailleau. Ce te te correspond à une partie de la retranscription de l'entretien ci-dessus. Cliquez sur la vidéo pour le regarder en intégralité. Cyril Adriaens-Allemand : Emmanuel Macron a annoncé hier soir que la France reconnaîtra l'État de Palestine en septembre prochain. Est-ce que vous saluez cette décision sans réserve ? Nathalie Delattre, ministre délguée au tourisme : Bien sûr, c'est une position historique que la France maintient depuis longtemps. Nous avions repris les négociations en 2023 et nous devions tenir, sous l'égide de l'Arabie saoudite, des discussions qui ont été reportées du fait de l'offensive israélienne sur l'Iran. C'est un processus qui reprend et qui doit aboutir. C'est pour ça que le président s'e prime. Il est important de le faire. Nous porterons donc cette voi lors de l'Assemblée générale des Nations unies en septembre. Le Premier ministre israélien Benjamin Netanyahou condamne cette décision qui, selon lui, récompense la terreur. Il y a un mois, quand on écoutait la porte-parole du gouvernement français, elle disait que les conditions n'étaient pas encore réunies. Qu'est-ce qui a changé ? Nous continuons à demander la libération des otages. Bien évidemment, nous soutenons Israël dans ce combat contre le terrorisme et le Hamas, mais il faut que nous puissions avancer sur cette question. Sur la population qui vit dans des conditions déplorables à Gaza, nous devons arriver à trouver une solution et la France est historiquement un médiateur qui recherche en permanence la pai . Nous investissons dans tous les conflits mondiau . Il est important que nous puissions avancer sur cette question de la Palestine. La France est le premier pays du G7 à faire ce pas. Emmanuel Macron doit s'entretenir avec ses homologues britanniques et allemands aujourd'hui. Que se passera-t-il si, en septembre au Nations unies, la France est seule ? Par e emple, l'Allemagne, à ce stade, n'est pas très encline à aller dans ce sens. Nous aurons donc porté notre voi et nous continuerons à porter cette nécessité. C'est symbolique ? Non. Nous espérons effectivement entraîner les autres pays. Je pense qu'il ne vous a pas échappé que nous devons résoudre ce conflit. Il nous apparaît que la solution à deu États , encore une fois, que nous portons historiquement, est celle qui permettra de pouvoir avancer sur ce conflit. Hier, lors d'un comité interministériel présidé par François Bayrou, 31 mesures ont été présentées pour booster le secteur du tourisme avec un objectif de 100 milliards d'euros de recettes d'ici à 2030. Nous sommes aujourd'hui à 71 milliards. Comment peut-on y arriver alors que, par e emple, cet été, certains restaurateurs et responsables d'hébergement tirent la sonnette d'alarme ? Quand on regarde les chiffres au global, nous avons des effets météorologiques qui impactent, bien évidemment, le début de cette saison : la canicule et, ensuite, on l'a vu tout à l'heure sur la météo, des endroits plus ou moins pluvieu . Quand on regarde les chiffres entre janvier et avril que nous avons déjà consolidés, nous avons plus 8 % d'arrivées, notamment internationales, sur le territoire et nous avons déjà battu un record sur la rentrée de nos recettes internationales. Donc le comité interministériel du tourisme a réaffirmé notre volonté de continuer à être la première destination mondiale, mais à travers un tourisme durable, innovant, inclusif, et puis effectivement cette ambition d'avoir 100 milliards de recettes internationales en amenant beaucoup plus de touristes étrangers et en leur permettant de rester plus longtemps, c'est-à-dire en améliorant notre offre touristique et en montant en gamme cette offre touristique. Qu'est-ce qui pêche dans la stratégie française ? Parce qu'à la fois, vous dites que nous sommes encore, peut-être plus longtemps, mais encore première destination en nombre de touristes, mais en même temps, les touristes dépensent peu en France. En fait, c'est la dépense moyenne, c'est-à-dire qu'il nous faut en France arriver à proposer des produits qui permettent au touristes de se poser dans une région, dans une destination. Aujourd'hui, nous avons plutôt des touristes de passage et c'est vrai qu'on arrive à avoir des formules de trois jours à Paris, trois jours à Bordeau , trois jours dans d'autres destinations, alors que nous souhaitons renforcer notre offre touristique. Il faut que nous arrivions à rénover notre hôtellerie, particulièrement dans le moyen et haut de gamme, les 4 et 5 étoiles, qui nous manquent aujourd'hui dans cette offre touristique. Mais nous avons d'autres atouts. Les campings, nous sommes le pays le plus équipé en plein air, et cela plaît, puisque notamment dans la ruralité, nous avons une augmentation des touristes qui cherchent des activités de plein air, mais aussi des visites patrimoniales, de la gastronomie et de l'œnotourisme. Nous avons des marges de progression sur l'ensemble de l'œnotourisme. Et ces marges de progression, cela veut dire des recettes, et cela veut dire aussi contribuer à l'amélioration de la situation de l'économie française.

Le groupe ferroviaire a dégagé un bénéfice de 950 millions d'euros au premier semestre, un huitième résultat positif consécutif, porté notamment par l'activité SNCF Voyageurs et la grande vitesse, TGV et Ouigo. : à REPORTAGE. \"Ici, c'est calme, c'est comme de la rela ation\" : la SNCF teste un espace à la gare de l'Est pensé pour les enfants et les adultes autistes 81,2 millions de passagers ont été transportés entre janvier et juin dans les TGV Inoui et les Ouigo. Une hausse de fréquentation d'1,7% par rapport à la même période en 2024. Et une hausse plus substantielle encore en termes de chiffres d'affaires pour la SNCF, en raison d'un pri moyen des billets plus élevé. Conséquence en partie d'un retour de la clientèle professionnelle, qui emprunte davantage la première classe. Continuer à investir massivement Au-delà de la grande vitesse, ce sont tous les types de trains qui ont vu leur fréquentation progresser : Intercités, TER et Transilien en Île-de-France. La direction du groupe indique déjà que cela va permettre de continuer à investir massivement dans l'entretien et le renouvellement du réseau ferroviaire. Mais les syndicats dénoncent le fait qu'il s'agisse d'une forme de ponction opérée par l'Etat sur les bénéfices de la SNCF, issus du travail des cheminots, et que cela profite au concurrents comme Trenitalia, qui n'est pas soumis au mêmes obligations de financement du réseau. les mots-clés associés à cet article SNCF Transports Éco / Conso Lancez la conversation",

(MA PPP) Un rapport d'e pertise visant EuropaFi, la filiale gérant la papeterie de la Banque de France basée à Vic-Le-Comte (Puy-de-Dôme), met en lumière, dans un rapport rendu public vendredi 25 juillet, des \"risques psycho-sociau \" au sein de l'entreprise, après le suicide d'un salarié le 18 novembre 2024, et dénonce un traitement \"encore largement insuffisant\" . Selon ICI Pays d'Auvergne (e -France Bleu), cet homme était employé depuis 11 ans à la papeterie, qui compte à ce jour 280 salariés, et avait été nommé contremaître en 2018. Dans le rapport, l'e pert du cabinet Technologia relève que \"le salarié e primait régulièrement des difficultés liées à sa charge de travail, notamment en raison du cumul des dimensions techniques et administratives de son poste\" . La direction en avait été informée, selon le rapport qui indique que, dès 2019, soit un an après sa promotion comme contremaître, des tensions sont relevées dans les évaluations internes. Une situation pointée ensuite dans tous les bilans annuels, tout comme une mauvaise ambiance et une surcharge de travail. Des \"signau d'alerte\" remontés en 2024 L'e pert observe un manque de soutien de la hiérarchie du contremaître et assure que \"la situation professionnelle difficile rencontrée par le salarié était connue de la direction et s’inscrivait dans la durée\". \"Plusieurs signau d’alerte ont été formellement remontés au cours de l’année 2024 par divers canau , témoignant d’un mal-être persistant\" , poursuit le rapport. \"Les réponses organisationnelles apportées apparaissent, dans l’analyse de l’e pert, tardives ou insuffisamment calibrées au regard de la gravité de la situation\" , assure l'e pert. Le salarié venait de se séparer de sa compagne, qui travaillait aussi chez EuropaFi, et avait été sous ses ordres. \"Sans préjuger d’un lien de causalité direct entre les événements professionnels et le passage à l’acte, l’e pert considère que la durée et l’intensité des difficultés rencontrées dans le cadre de son activité professionnelle ont très probablement contribué à une déstabilisation progressive\" , conclut le rapport. \"Les gens préfèrent rester et souffrir\" Ce point de vue est partagé par Hugo Coldeboeuf, secrétaire général de la CGT Banque de France. \"On ne peut jamais dire 'un suicide à une cause précise'. C'est multifactoriel, c'est un monde qui s'effondre. Et dans ce monde qui s'effondre, il y a le milieu professionnel\" , assure-t-il à ICI Pays d'Auvergne. Selon la CGT, ce rapport doit mener à la reconnaissance de ce suicide comme un accident du travail, pour \"une reconnaissance morale et d'apaisement du collectif de travail et de la famille\" . Hugo Coldeboeuf souligne qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un cas isolé, \"c'est le troisième suicide à la Banque de France en moins de deu ans, lié au conditions de travail\". Le rapport note aussi une \"fracturation préoccupante du corps social\" avec une réalité \"diamétralement différente selon les salariés au quels on s’adresse\". En effet, les salariés du site se divisent en deu statuts différents. D'un côté, les nouveau embauchés, sous statuts privés, de l'autre les MAD, les anciens agents de la Banque de France qui ont conservé le statut historique. Cette situation est dénoncée par Anthony Perruca, délégué CGT sur le site, joint par ICI Pays d'Auvergne. \"Ils ne vont pas démissionner, parce qu'il reste quelques avantages à la Banque de France, des acquis sociau . Donc les gens préfèrent souffrir et rester pour en bénéficier jusqu'à la retraite\" , dit-il. Une enquête demandée par la direction de la Banque de France Dans un communiqué datant du 1er juillet, la Banque de France juge que \"ce rapport participe malheureusement d’une tentative d’instrumentalisation d’un drame humain\". La Banque de France souligne que les salariés EuropaFi, interrogés dans le cadre de ce rapport, se disent à 76% plutôt ou tout à fait satisfait de leur situation professionnelle pour ceu sous statut privé, et à 52% pour ceu étant sous ancien statut Banque de France. La direction a de son côté diligenté une enquête de l’Inspection générale de la Banque de France, enquête dont seules les conclusions ont été communiquées au CSE et au représentants de pro imité de l'entreprise, note ICI Pays de Savoie. Cette e pertise e terne, menée par le cabinet Technologia, avait été décidée en Comité social et économique (CSE) en décembre. EuropaFi avait assigné son CSE en justice pour contester la demande d'e pertise. Le tribunal judiciaire de Clermont-Ferrand avait finalement donné raison au CSE, en février. les mots-clés associés à cet article Santé au travail Vie-professionnelle Carrière Emploi Éco / Conso Faits-divers Lancez la conversation",

(SYLVIE CAMBON / MA PPP) Le \"réarmement démographique\" voulu par Emmanuel Macron n'y a rien fait. Du moins, il attendra. Pour la première fois depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale, l'Insee a enregistré plus de décès que de naissances en France sur une période de douze mois consécutifs, souligne l'économiste François Geerolf sur . Entre le 1er juin 2024 et le 31 mai 2025, on décompte ainsi décès et naissances. Le solde naturel, c'est-à-dire la différence entre le nombre de naissances et celui des décès, est donc de -1 000. Le résultat d'une tendance à l'œuvre depuis plusieurs années, avec une baisse constante de la natalité, mais dont l'inversion était anticipée par l'Insee en 2027. Fermetures d'écoles, concurrence des générations, pénuries de main-d'œuvre... Pour comprendre les enjeu à moyen et long terme de ce changement démographique, franceinfo a interrogé Didier Breton, chercheur associé à l'Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined). Franceinfo : Comment e pliquer que le solde naturel soit devenu négatif en France ? Didier Breton : D'abord, il y a une tendance à la baisse du solde naturel en France depuis 2007, alors que le nombre de naissances diminue d'années en année. Face à ce constat, il n'y a pas eu le rebond de natalité attendu. La période ne semble pas favorable à un projet de parentalité ou d'agrandissement de la famille, pour des raisons économiques ou des incertitudes sur le futur . Le nombre d'enfants moyen par femme décroît alors que les couples vont décider de faire des enfants plus tard que dans les générations précédentes. En vingt ans, la part des adultes ne souhaitant pas avoir d'enfants a aussi augmenté. Une étude de Milan Bouchet-Valat et Laurent Toulemon parue en juillet (PDF) indique que 20% des 25-29 ans hésitent à devenir parents. Le modèle familial avec plusieurs enfants est de plus en érosion. De l'autre côté, on observe une augmentation du nombre de décès chaque année. C'est que la population en \"âge de mourir\" (au-dessus de 85 ans) est de plus en plus nombreuse : de 1945 à 1973, il y a eu énormément de naissances durant \"le baby-boom\" d'après-guerre. L'hiver dernier, par e emple, la France a connu une vague de mortalité en raison d'un épisode violent d'épidémie de grippe. \"C'est un phénomène qu'on observe partout en Europe et qui est amené à se poursuivre dans les années à venir. La France et son solde naturel positif étaient jusqu'alors une e ception dans le continent.\" Didier Breton, démographe à l'Ined à franceinfo Si cet indicateur est traditionnellement calculé entre chaque année civile, les si premiers mois de 2025 ne donnent pas l'impression que la tendance va s'inverser cette année. Quand cette baisse de la natalité aura-t-elle le plus d'effets pour notre société ? La baisse de naissances qu'on observe depuis 2007 n'aura ses premiers effets qu'en 2027 ou 2030, lorsque ces enfants nés atteindront l'âge adulte. Et le solde négatif qu'on observe aujourd'hui, et qui va continuer à baisser, n'aura ses premiers effets importants que dans 15-20 ans. C'est un effet domino, ce que l'on appelle l'inertie démographique : une population qui n'est pas encore née aujourd'hui va affecter les sociétés et l'économie durant les 90 ou 100 ans qui suivent. A quelles conséquences concrètes peut-on s'attendre ? Il y aura d'abord des conséquences économiques. Si nous n'avons pas recours à l'immigration, la population va diminuer en même temps que la taille du marché français et le nombre de consommateurs disponibles. Le premier secteur touché à court terme sera celui de la petite enfance : les assistantes maternelles, les entreprises vendant des produits pour bébé et des couches... Autre conséquence, il va y avoir moins d'enfants dans les écoles et maternelles. Dans les milieu rurau , cela peut se traduire par la fermeture de classes d'écoles, réduisant les places disponibles. En termes d'attractivité, c'est une catastrophe pour un maire de petite commune qui souhaite garder la population et les parents sur son territoire. Cette baisse ne va en effet pas affecter les territoires de la même manière. \"Dans les grandes villes, 2 000 enfants en moins auront moins d'impact que 20 enfants en moins dans une terre rurale. Certains territoires connaissent déjà des difficultés.\" Didier Breton, démographe à l'Ined à franceinfo Enfin, à plus long terme, moins d'enfants, c'est moins de personnes sur le marché de l'emploi dans 20 ans, c'est moins de cotisants pour des retraites, des pénuries de main-d'œuvre... S'il y a plus d'anciens que de jeunes, comment va-t-on pouvoir prendre en charge les plus âgés ? Il y a donc une vague en cours de baby-boomers qui arrivent à l'âge de la dépendance. A partir de 2030, il y aura de moins en moins de gens formés au métiers du soin. Et puis, les futurs jeunes feront-ils le choi de devenir médecins ? Si on ne fait rien, il y aura là de vraies conséquences, qui auront des coûts économiques importants. Avec cette dépendance, on va aussi par e emple observer une concurrence entre générations. Que ce soit pour les places à l'hôpital ou pour les rendez-vous chez les médecins. Ou pour les grandes élections. \"Où va se décider l'avenir du pays ? Par le haut ou pas le bas de la pyramide des âges ?\" Didier Breton, démographe à l'Ined à franceinfo Ce problème peut emporter tout notre modèle de cohésion sociale, c'est-à-dire le climat qui e iste entre différentes catégories de population, en particulier entre les âges. Emmanuel Macron a évoqué un \"réarmement démographique\" . Est-ce une façon de s'adapter à cette bascule ? On peut et on doit s'adapter. Les politiques vont en avoir l'obligation dans les années à venir et ne pourront pas faire comme si cela n'e istait pas. Tout est une question du modèle de société que l'on souhaite mettre en place. \"Ce qui est sûr, c'est que malgré les politiques natalistes, on ne peut pas forcer les gens qui n'ont pas envie d'être parents, sachant qu'avoir un enfant coûte du temps et de l'argent, et que l'on sait que la part des gens qui vont choisir de ne pas en avoir va augmenter.\" Didier Breton, démographe à l'Ined à franceinfo Il y a deu grands modèles de réponse choisis par les pays dans lesquels le solde naturel est négatif depuis plusieurs années. Le premier est celui de l'Allemagne et de l'Espagne. Les deu pays ont fait appel à l'immigration pour préserver leur économie et subvenir au besoins des métiers en tension. Mais pour cela, il faut être attractif. Ce sera un enjeu dans le futur : les pays d'Afrique et d'Asie connaîtront, eu aussi, une baisse de natalité dans les années à venir, ce qui va faire aussi baisser \"l'offre migratoire\". Dans un conte te de pénurie, ce sont les migrants qui auront le choi du pays. Un autre modèle a été choisi par le Japon, où la natalité diminue depuis 30 ans. Plutôt que de recourir à l'immigration, la nation a décidé d'augmenter la productivité par l'automatisation des tâches et la robotisation, pour combler le besoin de main-d'œuvre. Chaque stratégie est un choi de société. les mots-clés associés à cet article Grossesse Retraite Europe Éco / Conso Réforme des retraites Société Lancez la conversation",

Edité par l'egance 6médias France Télévisions JT de 20h Édition du jeudi 24 juillet 2025 Une bonne nouvelle pour les propriétaires qui ont du mal à se faire payer leur loyer. Depuis le 1er juillet, les huissiers sont autorisés à faire des saisies sur salaire, sans passer par un juge. Olivier Riera est propriétaire de deu appartements dans un immeuble de Pantin, en Seine-Saint-Denis. Il ne perçoit plus les loyers de ses locataires . Le locataire du troisième étage ne paie plus son loyer depuis plus d’un an et demi. \"Il n’y a pas moyen de se faire rembourser. C’est pour notre poche\" , réagit le propriétaire. Dans la cour du bâtiment, les locataires du second appartement, eu , doivent, dit-il, près de 5 000 euros. Olivier Riera a entamé une procédure judiciaire pour espérer récupérer ses loyers. Il devrait obtenir gain de cause prochainement. Sa procédure a duré un an et demi. Elle a été compliquée et coûteuse. Une procédure allégée depuis juillet 2025 Toutefois, depuis le 1er juillet 2025, le parcours est plus rapide. Le propriétaire n’a plus l’obligation de passer devant un magistrat. Il peut maintenant saisir un commissaire de justice, comme un huissier, qui tentera une médiation. Si celle-ci échoue, le loyer sera directement prélevé sur le salaire du locataire, un mois seulement après le début de la procédure.

À leur bord, les contrôleurs veillent au grain lorsque les passagers s'assoupissent. Notre journaliste a suivi les contrôleurs du train de nuit Paris-Nice, afin d'en apprendre plus sur leur métier. La routine du contrôleur de train de nuit commence par l’inspection du matériel. Un convoi de 200 mètres, dans lequel sont répartis 60 compartiments et 340 lits à vérifier. Tout y passe, y compris le plancher entre les voitures. Alors que les voyageurs sont assoupis, le contrôleur effectue une ronde une fois par heure, avant de partir se coucher et d’être remplacé par une seconde équipe pour le reste du trajet, jusqu’à Nice. 300 contrôleurs de train de nuit en France Pour accéder au poste de chef de bord – soit le titre officiel du contrôleur – il faut détenir le diplôme du bac avant de suivre une formation de quatre mois. Kévin, jeune contrôleur, touche un salaire net de 2 300 euros nets par mois avec les primes. Un salaire qui peut monter à 2 800 euros après vingt ans d’ancienneté. Si le métier permet de voyager dans toute la France, il faut accepter les horaires décalés et les découchés loin de sa famille, jusqu’à 14 soirs par mois.
