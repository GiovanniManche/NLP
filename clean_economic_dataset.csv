press release july euro area bank lending survey july credit standards for firm loans remained broadly unchanged credit standards tightened slightly for housing loans and more markedly for consumer credit housing loan demand continued to increase strongly while demand for firm loans remained weak according to the july bank lending survey bls euro area banks reported broadly unchanged credit standards banks internal guidelines or loan approval criteria for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the second quarter of net percentage of banks of chart banks also reported a slight net tightening of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase net percentage of and a more pronounced net tightening for consumer credit and other lending to households net percentage of for credit standards on loans to firms the net percentage was smaller than banks had e pected in the previous survey a net tightening of and follows the small net tightening in credit standards seen in the first quarter perceived risks related to the economic outlook continued to contribute to a tightening of credit standards whereas competition had an easing impact for the most part banks reported no specific additional tightening impact on their credit standards related to geopolitical uncertainty and trade tensions although they intensified their monitoring of the most e posed sectors and firms for loans to households for house purchase the net tightening followed the easing of credit standards seen in the first quarter but was lower than banks anticipated for both housing loans and consumer credit changes in risk perceptions and the risk tolerance of banks were the main drivers of the net tightening of credit standards for the third quarter of banks e pect credit standards to remain unchanged for firms ease slightly for housing loans and tighten further for consumer credit banks overall the actual agreed in loan contracts eased for loans to firms remained unchanged for housing loans and tightened for consumer credit in the second quarter of euro area banks reported a slight net increase in demand for loans or credit lines to firms chart with demand remaining weak overall this followed a small net decrease in loan demand in the previous quarter and was broadly in line with banks expectations in that quarter loan demand was supported by declining interest rates but dampened by global uncertainty and trade tensions while the impact of fi ed investment and inventories and working capital was neutral demand for housing loans continued to increase substantially in net terms declining interest rates improved housing market prospects and to a lesser e tent consumer confidence were the main drivers of the continued increase in housing loan demand demand for consumer credit and other lending to households increased only slightly with declining interest rates and other factors offsetting negative contributions from lower consumer confidence and spending on durable goods in the third quarter of banks e pect a net increase in loan demand from firms net percentage of a further substantial net increase for housing loans net percentage of and broadly unchanged demand for consumer credit euro area banks access to retail and wholesale funding improved slightly in the second quarter of driven by short term retail funding money markets and debt securities and remained broadly unchanged for securitisations over the next three months banks e pect access to these funding sources to remain broadly unchanged euro area banks reported that non performing loan npl ratios and other credit quality indicators had a net tightening impact on their credit standards across all loan categories as well as a net tightening impact on for loans to firms and consumer credit banks e pect these trends to continue in the third quarter for loans to firms and consumer credit driven mostly by pressures related to supervisory or regulatory requirements changes in credit standards and loan demand were heterogeneous across the main economic sectors in the first half of credit standards tightened in commercial real estate cre manufacturing wholesale and retail trade and to a lesser e tent in construction while they eased slightly across most services e cluding financial services and real estate and in residential real estate rre banks reported a net decrease in loan demand for construction manufacturing cre and wholesale and retail trade and net increases in rre and in the transport accommodation and food services sectors for the second half of in most of the main economic sectors banks e pect either broadly unchanged or easier credit standards and overall small changes in loan demand the e ception is rre for which banks e pect a further moderate increase banks continue to take firms climate performance into consideration in their lending policies reporting an easing impact on credit standards and for green firms and firms in transition and a tightening impact for high emitting firms over the past twelve months both physical risk and firms transition risk had a moderate net tightening impact on banks lending policies while climate related fiscal support continued to have an easing impact banks also reported a net increase in demand for loans to green firms and firms in transition owing to climate change while uncertainty over future climate regulation was perceived as an obstacle banks e pect a similar impact overall over the next twelve months based on a new question on the impact of climate change on housing loans banks reported an easing impact on credit standards for buildings with high energy performance and a tightening impact for buildings with low energy performance over the past twelve months they e pect a broadly corresponding impact over the next twelve months as the easing impact for new buildings mostly offset the tightening impact for old buildings the net impact of energy performance was low overall the physical risk of real estate was however an important driver of further net tightening in lending conditions overall and an even higher net percentage of banks reported that it will be a driver over the next year banks also reported a positive impact on loan demand for buildings with high and medium energy performance but a negative impact for those with low energy performance investment in energy performance was the key factor for climate related loan demand supported by preferential lending rates for increasing sustainability whereas uncertainty over future climate regulation was reported as a dampening factor for loan demand banks indicated that changes in e cess liquidity held with the eurosystem in the first half of had a neutral impact on bank lending conditions they e pect to see similar effects in the second half of the quarterly bls was developed by the eurosystem to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area the results reported in the july survey relate to changes observed in the second quarter of and changes e pected in the third quarter of unless otherwise indicated the july survey round was conducted

speech the digital euro legal tender in the digital age introductory statement by piero cipollone member of the executive board of the ecb at the committee on economic and monetary affairs of the european parliament brussels july thank you for inviting me to take part in this e change of views i would like to talk about why we need the digital euro and the cost of not pursuing it my message is simple the main reason for issuing a digital euro is to preserve the benefits of cash in the digital era to do so we need to complement physical cash with a digital form of cash the inability to use physical cash in online transactions or for digital payments at the point of sale deprives us of a key payment option reducing resilience competition sovereignty and ultimately consumers freedom to choose how to pay this increases the risks that european consumers merchants and policymakers face for a growing number of their transactions europeans lack access to central bank money the money that is backed by the sovereign and has legal tender status underpinning our monetary union because it is accepted everywhere in the euro area monetary sovereignty and people s freedom to pay with legal tender two sides of the same coin the eurosystem is committed to cash and will continue to issue it but people s habits are shifting towards digital payments as the role of online payments has grown the role of cash in day to day transactions has been declining at pace between and its share fell from to in volume terms and from to in value terms this has two important implications first the role of cash will be significantly reduced if we do not provide a digital equivalent if we fail to act we will fail to fulfil our responsibility as a central bank towards the people we serve second our monetary sovereignty is eroding people s ability to pay across the euro area with sovereign money cash and frequently choosing to do so is a key pillar of monetary sovereignty a digital form of cash would protect our sovereignty and ensure our monetary union is also a digital monetary union what s particularly concerning in europe is that the gap left by declining cash use is being filled by non european payment solutions for card payments only seven out of the euro area countries have a national card scheme these card schemes cannot be used in other euro area countries and are also losing market share domestically for e commerce european owned solutions are prevalent in only three euro area countries strengthening our legal tender to stop the erosion of our monetary sovereignty to address this situation the single currency package protects the rights of those who want to continue to pay with cash while complementing physical cash with a digital form of the legal tender the digital euro i believe we are being presented with a false choice a private pan euro area payment solution or a public one first it is not just about payments it is about the evolution of the money and second it is a historical fact that state issued money and money issued by private parties have typically coe isted reinforcing each other the cost of inaction since the start of the euro we have recognised the need for an integrated retail payments market this prompted the development of the single euro payments area sepa to harmonise bank transfers however sepa does not cover key use cases such as payments at the point of sale over the years private firms have made several attempts to create a pan european payment solution but difficulties in coordinating among market participants prevented those firms from delivering a scalable and unified system some years after the launch of the euro we still have no european payment solution that allows people to pay digitally throughout the euro area in stores for e commerce goods and services and from person to person let us take a leap of faith imagine things would be different this time and that banks would manage to work together to rapidly provide a pan european private payment solution would it still make sense to have the digital euro the answer is yes first the digital euro would help preserve money as a public good that is easily accessible to everyone and universally accepted across the euro area by contrast private money belongs to the competitive space so we cannot guarantee its acceptance by all merchants second the digital euro would enhance resilience we would have a reliable fallback in times of crisis complementing cash an especially important feature is that the digital euro would also function offline providing a secure payment method even without an internet connection moreover as is the case with cash we would be sure that all components of the digital euro remain in european hands third the digital euro would prevent market concentration the availability of legal tender and its wide adoption would put merchants in a stronger position to negotiate fees in addition the digital euro would create open standards with a wide acceptance network making it easier for payment service providers to scale up their solutions this would result in greater competition and innovation at european level conclusion let me conclude the treaty on the functioning of the european union entrusts you the co legislators to lay down the measures necessary for the use of the euro as the single currency we can together ensure that our currency is fit for the digital age by complementing physical cash and private payment initiatives with digital cash indeed the digital euro is key to preserving the benefits of cash in the digital era cash as legal tender is a cornerstone of public trust in currencies including the euro it supports the stability of our currency and the effectiveness of our monetary policy p cipollone the role of the digital euro in digital payments and finance contribution to bancaria based on remarks at the crypto asset lab conference on january february these are belgium the netherlands and portugal g central banks have stated the composite of central and commercial bank money convertible at par is essential to the safety and efficiency of the financial system and should remain the basis of the singleness of the currency see committee on payment and settlement systems the role of central bank money in payment systems bank for international settlements august the e ample of instant payments shows that despite advances in regulation and technology the market has failed to deliver a scalable solution due to problems in coordinating among market participants also the european payments council and industry groups have worked on common standards e g sepa cards framework but no concrete unification of card networks has materialised this contrasts with a historical e ample of ensuring resilience between and it was a state secret that the bundesbank held billion deutsche marks in substitute currency in the cochem bunker the deutsche mark had by then established its credibility as an international currency germany feared that counterfeit money could be smuggled into the country in large quantities in order to undermine confidence in the deutsche mark and bring down the economy had this happened the substitute currency would have been distributed to ensure the continuity of everyday commerce the digital euro rulebook would mandate common standards across the euro area the digital euro acceptance standards would be made available for free to private parties who would be able to use them as a basis for developing their services this would help private providers achieve pan european acceptance on a technical level leading to cost efficiencies and a more integrated european payment market the e pansion of both their geographical reach and their portfolio of products would in turn make it easier for them to compete internationally while technical acceptance would be guaranteed commercial agreements would still be

interview interview with econostream media interview with isabel schnabel member of the executive board of the ecb conducted by david barwick and marta vilar on july july ms schnabel abstracting from the still open question of tariffs would you say that developments since june support the idea that the ecb is in a good place weakening the case for another move yes we are in a good place disinflation is proceeding broadly as e pected even if services inflation and food inflation remain somewhat elevated we are now close to having successfully tackled past inflation shocks which is good news over the medium term inflation is projected to be at and inflation expectations are well anchored in view of this our interest rates are also in a good place and the bar for another rate cut is very high let me e plain first i see no risk of a sustained undershooting of inflation over the medium term core inflation is projected to be at target over the entire projection horizon the low energy price inflation is likely to be temporary and the fear of the e change rate appreciation putting downward pressure on underlying inflation is e aggerated in my view as the pass through is likely to be limited in fact this appreciation also reflects the new growth narrative in europe meaning there is a positive confidence effect which attracts capital and lowers financing costs second the economy is proving resilient economic growth in the first quarter of was better than e pected sentiment indicators have also surprised to the upside the composite purchasing managers inde rose again in june and it s noteworthy that manufacturing has continued to improve with strikingly all the forward looking indicators having continued their upward trend new orders new e port orders future output are all at three year highs this suggests that we re seeing more than just frontloading moreover the labour market remains resilient with unemployment at a record low and employment continuing to grow it seems that the uncertainty is weighing less on economic activity than we thought and on top of that we re e pecting a large fiscal impulse that will further support the economy so overall the risks to the growth outlook in the euro area are now more balanced it sounds like you see no grounds for the ecb to seriously consider further easing even if it were to wait before moving again there would only be a case for another rate cut if we saw signs of a material deviation of inflation from our target over the medium term and at the moment i see no signs of that is the potential cost of an unnecessary cut high enough to outweigh risk management arguments for a so called insurance cut i don t think that risk management considerations can justify another rate cut domestic inflation is still elevated and inflation expectations of households and firms are tilted to the upside additionally a more fragmented global economy and a large fiscal impulse pose upside risks to the inflation outlook over the medium term therefore from today s perspective a further rate cut is not appropriate i would also warn against fine tuning monetary policy to incoming data for e ample it would be risky to base a monetary policy decision solely on the evolution of energy prices because we ve seen oil prices fluctuate between usd and almost usd since march alone we should remain firmly focused on the medium term and on core inflation this is also in line with our updated monetary policy strategy which says that we need to be agile to recognise fundamental changes in the inflation environment but that we can tolerate moderate deviations from target if there s no risk of a de anchoring of inflation expectations we don t yet know the final tariff outcome but observers e pect europe to get away with a general along with individual tariffs on certain sectors and some e ceptions for others if you share this view what impact on growth and inflation do you e pect indeed it looks like tariff negotiations are moving towards our baseline scenario but of course there remains uncertainty about the outcome of the negotiations tariffs have a dampening effect on economic activity in the short run however if the negotiations are concluded successfully this will lower uncertainty which would support consumption and investment as regards inflation i see a net inflationary effect over the medium term because the dampening effect from a weaker global economy and potential trade diversion is likely to be offset or even overcompensated by supply side effects which are not included in our standard projection models this includes cost push shocks rippling through global value chains supply chain disruptions and the loss of efficiency from a more fragmented world you said the bar for another rate cut is very high is that because we re approaching accommodative territory or are we already in it i think we are becoming accommodative if you look at the latest bank lending survey you see of banks reporting that interest rates are boosting the demand for mortgages while only say they re holding demand back moreover the natural rate of interest may have increased recently due to the historic shift in german fiscal policy this is also reflected in financial markets where real forward rates have moved up which reflects the e pected higher demand for capital including from the private sector that means that for a given level of the policy rate our policy becomes more accommodative and this is what s also reflected in the pick up in bank lending what other indicators do you rely on to gauge your level of accommodation we look at general economic developments which also reflect the restrictiveness of our monetary policy and as i said the economy has proven more resilient than we had thought you described the pass through of the eur usd e change rate as limited can you be more specific is there a point at which this suddenly changes i find the debate about the e change rate appreciation e aggerated i do not remember people having a similar concern when the e change rate was moving towards parity in early and this did not prevent us from cutting rates further if you take a longer perspective and look at the past two decades we ve had comparable or even larger appreciations with a rather limited impact on inflation there are reasons to believe that the pass through may be limited this time as well especially to underlying inflation first the source of the shock matters in this case the stronger e change rate is also a reflection of a positive confidence effect and investors belief that the euro area s growth potential may be higher than thought moreover you see a rebalancing of investors into the euro area which tends to lower financing costs counteracting the tightening effect of the e change rate second more than half of our imports are invoiced in euro which reduces the pass through firms may also use the occasion of lower import costs to protect their profit margins rather than pass these lower costs on to consumers finally the impact of the e change rate on competitiveness and foreign demand is mitigated by the high import content of our e ports but to get back to your second question we do not target the e change rate and we do not respond to any particular e change rate level e change rates enter our projection models via the assumptions and we know that they can change in either direction at any point so further appreciation is manageable indefinitely as long as it remains reasonably gradual we always have to monitor what is happening i don t like to make very general statements about what could happen at the moment it s manageable you recently said that the estimate of the impact of higher fiscal spending incorporated into the projections is relatively conservative what s being underappreciated is it the timing the composition of the spending i see several aspects the first is indeed timing we ve been positively surprised by the frontloading of spending plans by the german government it seems they re determined to deliver on their promises the second aspect is fiscal multipliers they could be higher than assumed depending on how the money is spent generally they tend to be higher when the money is spent for investment and the details of defence e penditures also matter what share is going to be sourced domestically and what share is used for r d related e penditures a third very important point is that our models may not fully capture the complementarity between public and private investment that is that private investment is being crowded in by public investment just recently a group of large german corporations announced that they are planning a large investment programme which would amplify the positive effect of public spending how much potential do you see for a stronger than anticipated fiscal impulse to alter the inflation outlook and thus your policy calibration in the second half of this year the fiscal measures are going to play out mainly over the medium term not the short term but inflation could eventually pick up if the economy hits capacity constraints also due to demographic developments which will accelerate over the coming years your remarks seem to confirm that the ecb is not unhappy about the fact that the us dollar has been weak do you see a risk that the public discussion could provoke a us reaction the ecb needs to worry about the current situation risks undermining the e orbitant privilege of the us dollar a privilege the united states has enjoyed over many decades which has led to lower financing costs for american households firms and the government this offers a historical chance for the euro area to foster the international role of the euro as a global reserve invoicing and funding currency to reap some of those benefits but there are three important prerequisites the first is a revival of euro area growth the second is safeguarding the rule of law and security including in military terms and the third is a large and liquid eu bond market on the savings and investment union how can the ecb while staying within its mandate play a stronger role in highlighting how structural inefficiencies in cross border capital flows impede monetary policy transmission and private risk sharing we ve been very vocal about the savings and investment union the president has given several speeches and the governing council has issued its own communication on the topic this is because integration is closely related to our mandate our monetary policy is more effective in an integrated market integration improves monetary policy transmission by increasing private risk sharing and fostering convergence this is firmly within our mandate but let me also stress that the savings and investment union is about more than financial integration it s about fostering innovation and economic growth this concerns not just the availability of capital especially risk capital but also the possibility for firms to scale up within the single market we know that the internal hurdles within the single market are very high some estimates show they re much higher than the tariffs that we may be facing from the united states so one important part of the savings and investment union is to reduce these barriers within the single market i think the th regime for innovative companies is a very promising proposal to allow those companies to scale up easily all over europe the ecb can only inform the debate through speeches and analysis but in the end progress will depend on the political will of governments back to the united states where donald trump is calling daily on federal reserve chair jerome powell to resign in the past hours we ve had new speculation about who the next fed chair might be even if powell stays to the end of his term there could be an announcement long before that and his intended successor may start to make public pronouncements about his intentions that lead to market repricing and an even stronger euro does this worry you and more broadly are you concerned about any other changes that could disadvantage europe if a more trumpy fed chair emerges the current discussion is testimony to the importance of central bank independence and the federal reserve is leading by e ample it s very dangerous when you have direct interference by governments in monetary policy because this can destroy the trust that has been built over decades one concrete advantage of independence is that it reduces risk premia by challenging fed independence risk premia may move up which would increase rather than lower interest rates overall i would never underestimate the institutional resilience of the fed so i remain optimistic does this optimism also reflect the fact that you just had the opportunity to speak with chair powell at the ecb forum on central banking in sintra portugal absolutely as e cess liquidity continues to decline are you observing any emerging signs of segmentation whether across jurisdictions or across bank tiers in the transmission of short term interest rates there are no signs of segmentation in fact with quantitative tightening qt proceeding market functioning has improved because collateral scarcity has gone down our new operational framework can deal very well with the heterogeneity across the euro area any bank can access our operations at any time at the same rate for the amount that they need based on a broad set of eligible collateral so far the banks recourse to our operations has been rather limited because e cess liquidity is still abundant and that is also reflected in market funding being more favourable than our operations over time e cess liquidity is going to go down and eventually the situation will change and more and more banks will access our operations we are observing that process very carefully even if market function still appears smooth are there any early indicators you re watching especially closely we are closely monitoring the functioning of money markets and we have a whole range of indicators for that but at the moment we don t have any concerns on a related subject as balance sheet reduction continues do you see any risk that at some point it could impair monetary policy transmission or disrupt market functioning not at all it s important to understand the functioning of our operational framework which is designed in a way that ensures smooth monetary policy transmission in line with our decision the monetary policy bond portfolios under the asset purchase programme app and the pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp are going to be run down to zero at some point once the ecb balance sheet is growing again we will provide a significant part of banks structural liquidity needs via structural operations namely longer term lending operations and a structural bond portfolio but these are distinct from quantitative easing qe which remains a tool for e ceptional circumstances that is going to be used more sparingly in the future with sovereign spreads generally contained for now do you view the current pace of the app rundown as appropriate yes it s running smoothly in the background and our e perience with our gradual and predictable approach has been very positive what could trigger a change in the pace to change the pace of qt you would need to have a monetary policy argument and we said that our unconventional tools are to be used when we are near the effective lower bound based on a comprehensive cost benefit analysis this is not our situation today hence the plan is to run down the monetary policy bond portfolios to zero the provision of liquidity for the implementation of our monetary policy won t be done via qe which is a stance instrument but rather via our weekly lending operations and at a later stage the structural operations once e cess liquidity has declined to the point where demand for additional central bank liquidity begins to rise the time lag between the cut off date for the technical assumptions and the publication of the projections is quite long and in this volatile world it seems that this delay could compromise the reliability of the projections is this approach still justified this lag is mainly due to organisational reasons especially when we are running the projection e ercise together with the entire eurosystem there is a huge machinery to be managed with many people to be coordinated and the outcome then has to be incorporated into the material sent to the governing council the timelines are already very tight but more fundamentally your question reveals a common misunderstanding about our projections in the strategy assessment we stressed the importance of the uncertainty surrounding our baseline projections this uncertainty stems from the assumptions and it also comes from more fundamental uncertainty like the outcome of tariff negotiations but it s a mistake to focus only on the point estimates what the projections give you is not just this number which is almost certainly wrong and may change from day to day but a range of plausible outcomes this range is what we should focus on because the point estimates alone may be misleading if you do not also consider the uncertainty to what e tent is the return to inflation in contingent on regulatory measures like the eu s new emissions trading system ets and does this raise credibility risks if those inputs prove unreliable in general projecting energy prices is complicated we are using futures prices in our staff projections even though they are not necessarily a good predictor of energy prices here we have an additional complication in that the new ets has its own uncertainties such as when it will come and how large its effects are going to be and this brings me back to the point that we should focus on core inflation acknowledging that whatever happens with respect to energy as we ve seen in the recent inflation surge may feed into core inflation especially when prices rise in concluding the strategy assessment the ecb committed to act forcefully or persistently in response to large sustained inflation deviations what criteria would lead you to conclude that it s appropriate to act forcefully or persistently the strategy assessment implies that we can tolerate moderate deviations from our inflation target as long as inflation expectations are firmly anchored but when we see a risk of a sustained deviation from the target in either direction that could de anchor inflation expectations we will act appropriately forcefully or persistently depending on the situation at hand and based on a comprehensive cost benefit analysis what this means is that first we have to be agile in order to detect a fundamental shift in the inflation environment we were lacking this agility at the time of the recent inflation surge as it took us some time to recognise that we had shifted very quickly from a low inflation environment to a high inflation one we want to be more agile to be able to react to such a change more rapidly second we have to pay a lot of attention to inflation expectations not just market based inflation expectations because these may be subject to a monkey in the mirror problem and may merely reflect our own thinking it s important to look at a broad set of indicators including household and firm inflation expectations and in fact if you look at the consumer e pectations survey you see that household inflation expectations reacted relatively early to the change in the inflation environment so this can give us useful signals and the word sustained means e tending into the medium term i m always talking about the medium term as this is what matters for our monetary policy but sustained means that it s not just temporary and we all know that it s difficult to judge whether something is temporary or not but we will have to deal with that in the future in the wake of the strategy assessment does anything change about the weights you attach to model based outputs your judgement or real time indicators what i think is changing is our approach to data dependence over the past few years data dependence played a very important role the incoming data served as a cross check to verify whether the data were in line with the projected decline in inflation over time this allowed us to cut interest rates at a time when domestic inflation was still elevated now we ve entered a new phase in which we are using incoming data to assess whether there could be a sustained deviation of inflation from target over the medium term scenario analysis helps us to navigate the uncertainty that we are facing and the incoming data can tell us which scenario is most likely to materialise of course projection models have their shortcomings and we have to continuously improve the models as we ve done over recent years for e ample in our analysis of the impact of tariffs on economic activity trade policy uncertainty played a very important role but now we re seeing that the economy is more resilient than we e pected this could be an indication that the impact of trade policy uncertainty is smaller than thought another e ample is the modelling of the supply side effects of tariffs which are currently not in our projection models how do you evaluate the prospects for germany to emerge from the economic doldrums germany has been facing severe structural weaknesses and a loss in competitiveness to escape stagnation it will have to implement growth enhancing policies the fiscal package is one important ingredient but just spending money will not be enough first you have to make sure that the money is spent wisely meaning on investment not consumption second the spending has to be accompanied by comprehensive structural reforms including of the social security system especially given demographic developments we see a clear turnaround in sentiment in the german economy but now the german government has to deliver i see a chance to escape low growth and this chance should not be wasted so you share the optimism e pressed by bundesbank president joachim nagel earlier this week yes i m also optimistic and with regard to the change in the german attitude towards fiscal spending what do you think the implications are for euro area growth and inflation germany is in a situation in which it can e pand its government spending because it has fiscal space if done properly this can help increase potential growth which would also have positive spillovers to the rest of the euro area this may go along with higher interest rate costs but if potential growth increases at the same time this is manageable traditionally we ve had the core rather fiscally conservative countries of the euro area on the one hand and the more fiscally rela ed periphery countries on the other do you see this division being blurred as a consequence of the new german fiscal attitude germany is in a very different position from countries like france and italy those countries are facing much more difficult decisions when they want to increase defence spending as foreseen they will have to reduce their spending elsewhere which is politically very demanding so i think the difference in the fiscal situations is still there when you speak publicly how do you balance your own preferences and own views with the need to represent the ecb and its institutional interests one always has to strike the right balance but i believe that the transparency about the diversity of views within the governing council is a feature not a bug it enhances our credibility it also helps market participants better understand the discussions in the governing council and detect certain shifts in policies before the decision has been taken that ultimately helps the transmission of our monetary policy i have always been loyal to our collegial decisions and i try to e plain their rationale in public but of course when i see important new narratives that are relevant for the monetary policy discussion i e press my views i e plain them in comprehensive speeches based on empirical analysis and i hope that that helps the debate,ECB-RSS,Interview,True,English,0
speech shifting payment landscape what a digital euro will bring speech by piero cipollone member of the executive board of the ecb at banka slovenije ljubljana july it is a pleasure to speak to you today the ongoing shift in the way we pay is affecting the fundamental fabric of our economies whether we are consumers browsing digital marketplaces entrepreneurs pursuing digital innovation or decision makers facing the digital transition we are all involved in reshaping payments payments are more than a means of settling transactions they are the lifeblood of a modern economy and in a digital world our economies will only be as competitive inclusive autonomous and resilient as our payments are slovenia has put the digital transformation at the heart of its economic strategy aiming to place the country among the top five most digitalised economies in europe by an innovative and striving digital payments ecosystem can play a key role in this journey as a central bank our responsibility is to accompany and enable this transition we must ensure that the shift to digital payments enhances accessibility and efficiency without creating fragmentation or new dependencies let me be clear upfront this does not mean abandoning cash cash serves us well providing a european means of payment that is accessible accepted throughout the euro area and continuously available people remain attached to cash for good reasons and we are committed to continuing to provide it in fact we will soon start preparations for a third series of euro banknotes which will bear a new design but cash cannot be used for online payments which represent a growing share of our day to day transactions so we need to e tend its benefits to the digital sphere by introducing a digital euro we would aim to offer a digital equivalent of cash which preserves europeans freedom to pay with sovereign money is free for basic use preserves privacy fosters resilience and is accepted throughout the euro area for any digital payment in preparing for a digital euro we are carrying out one of our core tasks as defined in the treaty providing a means of payment with legal tender status and issuing money as a public good given this fundamental role if we were the only player in payments that did not go digital it would be fair to question whether we would be fulfilling our mandate by preparing for a digital euro we are simply adapting to evolving technologies and preferences this is particularly important in a monetary union like the euro area where years after the launch of the euro we still lack a european solution that enables people to pay digitally throughout the euro area and for all types of payments and it is especially relevant today at a time when dependencies on non european solutions could be weaponised a digital euro would be a public private cooperation with european payment service providers playing a key role in its distribution this would allow them to retain fees and data and would also enable banks to maintain client relationships by contrast these relationships could be threatened by payment solutions that seek to bypass banks such as stablecoins which are currently dominated by non bank and non european issuers and mostly denominated in dollars moreover a digital euro would enable payment service providers to scale up and offer their solutions throughout the euro area by leveraging the digital euro s infrastructure and acceptance network this would remedy the current state of digital payments which is a case in point of the situation described by mario draghi namely that the fragmentation of the european market along national lines prevents european firms from being competitive on a european level let alone globally in my remarks today i will first explore the challenges presented by the current digital transition in payments i will then e plain how the digital euro offers opportunities to address them the shifting landscape for payments slovenia offers an appealing snapshot of the transformation which is under way in many european economies slovenians are still deeply attached to cash in nearly two thirds of payments at physical locations in slovenia were made in cash yet digitalisation has been advancing steadily with the share of card payments at physical locations rising to in up from in this development is not unique to slovenia across the euro area increasing digitalisation means that online shopping now accounts for over a third of day to day retail transactions while cash payments have fallen to just in value terms this shift underscores the importance for us as central banks to not only safeguard trust in money in physical form but increasingly in digital form too our robust defence of cash stems directly from our mandate to issue money that europeans can use and access throughout the euro area for their day to day transactions in fact our work on the digital euro follows logically from our defence of cash in a world where cash cannot be used for e commerce transactions and where people also increasingly prefer to pay digitally at physical locations we must provide a digital equivalent of cash this will preserve the freedom of europeans to pay knowing that a digital euro will be accepted wherever they can opt to pay digitally and it will allow merchants to reconcile their customers preference to pay digitally with the benefits of cash as a means of payment that protects them from e cessive fees and network disruptions if we failed to act we would not only be failing to fulfil our mandate we would also risk the digital transformation reversing the progress we have made with euro cash at present we have no sovereign and inclusive digital means of payment with legal tender status as a result the growing use of digital payments risks entrenching our dependency on a small number of private non european players subjecting our money to the kindness of strangers this dependency already results in higher fees for merchants and the transfer of ta payers money in the form of lost seigniorage outside of europe so today i would like to emphasise three major challenges posed by the ongoing transformation the first is that the increased use of digital payments results in a growing reliance on non european payment providers which is cause for concern two thirds of card based transactions in the euro area are processed by international schemes some euro area countries are entirely dependent on non european systems for payments slovenia is a case in point despite efforts to promote local schemes the slovenian payments ecosystem remains reliant on international card schemes which dominate the market this dependency on non european payment solutions means that decisions taken outside europe could affect european consumers ability to seamlessly conduct everyday digital transactions hindering europe s strategic autonomy the second challenge is the persistent fragmentation of the european payments market despite the clear benefits of integration banks have not managed to unite the market the lack of compelling commercial incentives especially given the profitability and deep rooted nature of national payment schemes has discouraged investment in a pan european solution additionally coordination among banks each with distinct interests priorities and legacy investments has proven difficult and even when the infrastructure and a european scheme are in place like the target instant payment settlement tips infrastructure and the sepa instant credit transfer scheme we have not seen the emergence of pan european instant account to account payment solutions at the point of sale european providers do not have the incentive or the capacity to invest in competitive user friendly front end solutions across the euro area for e ample slovenia s instant payment scheme flik offers a promising user e perience across various payment situations however its reach remains limited because it is only available to customers of slovenian banks e cluding non residents and domestic users of foreign banks moreover merchant acceptance of flik does not yet match that of traditional card payments partly because its customer base is still limited this reflects a vicious circle where limited acceptance discourages adoption and low adoption disincentivises acceptance by merchants as well as reducing competition this makes it impossible to scale up the solutions offered by payment service providers that are unable to massively invest in a european wide acceptance network instead as the use of digital payments increases we are left with a patchwork of domestic solutions that lack the reach and scale to compete effectively across the eu and sometimes not even at the national level in slovenia karanta a national scheme backed by the largest domestic bank had a market share of just in this fragmentation is not just inefficient it makes digital payments more e pensive and less convenient than they could be placing an unnecessary burden on both consumers and merchants it is estimated that merchants across the euro area pay around billion every year to process international debit cards the third challenge relates to the user e perience offered by existing solutions in slovenia for e ample consumers are forced to use multiple apps cards and platforms to make payments resulting in a fragmented and often frustrating e perience these issues are not specific to slovenia they reflect a wider european challenge the lack of a european wide acceptance network for an open digital payment infrastructure that matches the reality of our increasingly digital and interconnected economies a digital euro for everyday payments in light of these challenges we need to ensure that the benefits of digital payments are enjoyed by all while at the same time safeguarding our sovereignty and the trust that underpins our single currency a digital euro would ensure that central bank money remains universally accessible for everyday transactions not just in physical form but also digitally it would guarantee that citizens can pay anywhere in the euro area using a trusted risk free instrument issued by the eurosystem this is consistent with the eurosystem s mandate under the eu treaties to issue the only means of payment that has legal tender status a digital euro would be a modern e pression of monetary sovereignty and let me say it again the digital euro is not intended to replace cash it would complement it we recognise that people across the euro area and especially in slovenia are strongly attached to cash it remains a vital tool for inclusion personal freedom and resilience we are unwavering in our commitment to cash at the same time our responsibility as a central bank is to ensure that as payments become increasingly digital citizens can continue to benefit from the trust and security that public money provides in the long run maintaining a direct link to a central bank issued means of payment that is usable at the point of sale across all use cases may be essential in preserving trust in commercial bank money moreover without a public digital alternative consumers and merchants would be increasingly dependent on the terms prices and data practices set by a few mostly non european private actors for instance over the past few years the average net merchant service charges in the eu have nearly doubled despite regulatory efforts to contain them introducing a digital euro would provide an attractive alternative to foreign payment solutions and is the only way to ensure europe s monetary sovereignty it would guarantee that the euro can always be used for digital payments anywhere in the euro area ensuring that europeans retain the freedom to make transactions seamlessly and securely independent of decisions taken outside the eu moreover the digital euro would address the persistent fragmentation that is hampering the retail payments market the lack of incentives and coordination among european banks to develop a continent wide solution for payments at the point of sale is understandable but hard to overcome given the significant investments that are needed to challenge entrenched foreign providers their acceptance network and their proprietary standards instead national payment solutions remain dependent on non european firms to offer a comparable in shop payment e perience as is the case for cross border or tap to pay payments for e ample so just as the introduction of euro banknotes united europe years ago and brought tangible benefits to its citizens the digital euro has the potential to create a truly integrated digital payments landscape that preserves the two tier payment system and the healthy equilibrium between public and private money that has served us so well for so long as central bank money it would have legal tender status meaning it would be accepted everywhere instantly generating powerful network effects leveraging its open standards and acceptance network would give european payment providers the scale and certainty they need to innovate and e pand this would also benefit banks who are currently losing fees and data to the dominant international payment solutions and could soon also lose deposits to stablecoins which are dominated by non european firms and are denominated in us dollars for of their value for european payment service providers establishing common standards through the digital euro would enable platforms such as flik to e tend their reach domestically and to operate across all euro area countries from the outset just as easily as national schemes do within national borders this would open up the market to fairer competition forcing established players to adjust the costs they impose on merchants particularly small and medium sized enterprises consumers would ultimately benefit through lower prices we are designing the digital euro platform in such a way that it e pands the range of possible conditional payments think of automatic reimbursements in the event of train or flight delays for e ample this will increase choice and stimulate innovation leading to a richer and more user friendly e perience for everyone the digital euro would rely on a new settlement ledger intended to support advanced payment functionalities including conditional payments our prototyping and e perimentation have shown that such payments can be implemented by leveraging application programming interfaces or apis as they re known in recent months we have partnered with some merchants fintech companies start ups banks and other payment service providers including from slovenia to explore the potential of the digital euro to drive innovation we will share our findings soon the digital euro would offer a comprehensive and smooth user e perience for consumers that covers all use cases payments in shops online and between individuals it would provide integrated online and offline functionalities all while upholding the highest privacy standards the offline functionality would offer cash like privacy with transaction details known only to the payer and the payee such an all in one solution does not currently e ist and its introduction would mark a significant step forward for europe conclusion let me conclude building an agile and robust digital payments ecosystem is essential for europe s digital transformation ignoring this task risks further fragmentation and dependencies resulting in a less convenient and more costly payment e perience for consumers and merchants including in slovenia the digital euro offers a solution a european public good that will complement cash ensuring trust sovereignty and universal access to secure cost free payments across the euro area it will empower people and businesses in slovenia and beyond to transact easily and safely online and offline at home and across borders and it will allow european private payment solutions to scale up and become more competitive ultimately the digital euro is more than a currency innovation it is a public commitment to the future of europe s digital economy it embodies our shared values of openness resilience and fairness ensuring that as our economies evolve no one is left behind and that europe remains in control of its monetary destiny slovenian ministry of economic development and technology strategy for the digital transformation of the economy the eurosystem has

speech the monetary agenda at the ecb remarks by philip r lane member of the executive board of the ecb at the house of the euro brussels july my goal today in these remarks is to outline the current monetary agenda at the ecb i will start with the monetary policy stance before turning to our updated monetary policy strategy i will then briefly discuss the euro area bond market before concluding with a monetary perspective on the digital euro project the monetary policy stance in a recent speech i assessed that the challenge of returning inflation to the target after the inflation surges can be considered to be largely complete the orientation now for the monetary policy stance is to make sure that the current shocks and prospective new shocks hitting the economy do not lead to medium term deviations of inflation from our two per cent target in terms of significant data developments in recent months there has been a marked drop in energy prices and a substantial appreciation of the euro these forces played an important role in the june eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections in addition the fiscal outlook has materially changed for the coming years with the overall fiscal deficit looking set to remain above three per cent over the projection horizon guarding against the risk of temporary deviations from target turning into longer term deviations was an important factor in our june decision to cut rates by basis points by supporting the pricing pressure needed to generate target consistent inflation in the medium term this cut helps ensure that the projected negative inflation deviation over the next eighteen months remains temporary and does not convert into a longer term deviation of inflation from the target currently there is high uncertainty about the future of the international trade system this uncertainty e tends beyond the calibration of new tariff regimes and includes the possibility of a broader set of non tariff barriers a deeper intertwining of economic policies and security policies and possible revisions to the treatment of foreign portfolio investors and foreign direct investors especially under current conditions of high uncertainty it is essential to remain data dependent and take a meeting by meeting approach in making monetary policy decisions with no pre commitment to any particular future rate path in addition to observing how activity and inflation are actually behaving data dependence also e tends to the incoming data on policy settings outside the monetary domain since shifts in international and domestic policy regimes are highly relevant for future inflation dynamics our updated monetary policy strategy the emphasis on two sided uncertainty about inflation dynamics very much reflects the analysis that underpins the recently announced update to our monetary policy strategy in addition to the geopolitical tensions outlined above our updated monetary policy strategy statement also identified ongoing structural shifts related to digitalisation artificial intelligence demography the threat to environmental sustainability and changes in the international financial system as suggesting that the inflation environment will remain uncertain and potentially more volatile with larger target deviations in both directions posing challenges for the conduct of monetary policy in our assessment is that the symmetric two per cent medium term inflation target which has served us well and remains unchanged is best protected by appropriately forceful or persistent monetary policy action in response to large sustained deviations of inflation from the target in either direction to avoid deviations becoming entrenched through de anchored inflation expectations in the event of significant disinflationary shocks the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates needs to be taken into account in the event of significant inflationary shocks possible non linearities in price and wage setting need to be taken into account the fle ibility of the medium term orientation recognises that the appropriate monetary policy response to a deviation of inflation from the target is conte t specific and depends on the origin magnitude and persistence of the deviation subject to maintaining anchored inflation expectations it also allows the governing council in its monetary policy decisions to cater for other considerations relevant to the pursuit of price stability the governing council bases its monetary policy decisions including the evaluation of the proportionality of its decisions and potential side effects on an integrated assessment of all relevant factors our updated strategy makes e plicit that our monetary policy decisions incorporate not only the most likely path for inflation and the economy but also surrounding risks and uncertainty including through the appropriate use of scenario and sensitivity analyses a systematic but conte t specific approach to incorporating the surrounding risks and uncertainty can include in addition to conducting a regular risk assessment analysing the sensitivity of projections and policy choices to changes in the underlying technical assumptions and model parameters as well as e ploring a range of alternative scenarios especially in relation to specific risk events in the internal preparation of monetary policy decisions ecb staff have conducted sensitivity and scenario analyses for many years in recent years some of this analysis has been published this includes scenarios related to the pandemic the unjustified russian invasion of ukraine the conflicts in the middle east and trade policy uncertainty as we implement the updated monetary policy strategy the incorporation of risks and uncertainty will be enhanced both in the internal preparation of monetary policy decisions and where appropriate in the communication of our decisions while our primary instrument is the setting of our policy rates the governing council may also employ other instruments as appropriate to steer the monetary policy stance when the policy rates are close to the lower bound or to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission the list of unconventional instruments includes longer term refinancing operations asset purchases negative interest rates and forward guidance the incorporation of risks and uncertainty into monetary policy decisions also has implications for the use of such instruments in particular the choice design and implementation of instruments will enable an agile response to new shocks and will appropriately reflect the intended aims whether the calibration of the monetary policy stance or the protection of monetary policy transmission subject to a comprehensive proportionality assessment a more resilient euro area financial architecture our updated monetary policy strategy statement also assesses that a more resilient financial architecture supported by progress on the savings and investments union the completion of banking union and the introduction of a digital euro would also support the effectiveness of monetary policy in this evolving environment it is beyond the scope of these remarks to review the full policy agenda in relation to the savings and investments union and the completion of banking union of course the net gains from improving financial intermediation and financial integration depend on the scale of progress in implementing the pro growth economic reform agenda as laid out in the draghi and letta report the european commission s competitiveness compass provides a concrete roadmap for action and its proposals including on simplification should be swiftly adopted let me pick up on an important dimension of improving the euro area financial architecture by briefly discussing the potential value of an e panded pool of euro denominated safe assets in making the euro area capital market more attractive for both european and global investors the bund is the highest rated large country national bond in the euro area however the stock of bunds is too small relative to the size of the euro area or the global financial system especially in the conte t of much smaller and less volatile spreads other national bonds also directionally contribute to the stock of safe assets while the residual potential volatility in spreads and the lower liquidity of these bonds ultimately put a ceiling on their contribution to the supply of safe asset supply the overall attractiveness of the euro area bond market ultimately depends on each member state ensuring fiscal sustainability including through the shared commitment to implement the european fiscal framework in a rigorous manner in principle common bonds backed by the combined fiscal capacity of the eu member states should constitute a high grade category of safe assets however the current stock of such bonds is simply too small to foster the necessary liquidity and risk management services e g derivative markets and repo markets that are part and parcel of serving as a safe asset moreover as it stands the stock of supranational euro bonds is currently projected to shrink over time in view of the scheduled repayment of the ngeu bonds and over time the retirement of esm bonds as the esm loans get repaid there are several ways to e pand the stock of common bonds for instance the member countries could decide to finance investment in european public goods through more common debt from a public finance perspective it is natural to match european public goods with common debt in order to align the financing with the area wide benefits of such public goods in addition to eu wide initiatives there could also be scope for common issuance by sub groups of member countries in the conte t of possible coalition of the willing shared investment projects furthermore in order to meet the rising global demand for euro denominated safe assets more quickly there are a number of ways to generate a larger stock of safe assets from the current stock of national bonds for instance olivier blanchard and ángel ubide have proposed that the blue bond red bond scheme which was originally floated in be re e amined under the blanchard ubide proposal each member country would ringfence a dedicated revenue stream for e ample a certain amount of indirect ta revenues that could be used to service commonly issued bonds in turn the proceeds of issuing common bonds blue bonds would be deployed to purchase a given amount of the national bonds red bonds of each participating member state this mechanism would result in a larger stock of blue bonds and a lower stock of red bonds while this type of financial reform was originally proposed during the euro area sovereign debt crisis the conditions today are far more favourable especially if the scale of blue bond issuance were to be calibrated in a prudent manner in order to mitigate some of the identified concerns in particular the blanchard ubide proposal gives the e ample of a stock of blue bonds corresponding to per cent of gdp just to illustrate the scale of the required fiscal resources to back this level of issuance if bond yields were in the range of to per cent on average the servicing of blue bond debt would require ringfenced ta revenues in the range of to per cent of gdp while this would constitute a significant shift in the current allocation of ta revenues between national and eu levels it would still leave ta revenues predominantly at the national level the ratio of ta revenues to gdp in the euro area ranges from around to per cent the shared payoff would be the reduction in debt servicing costs generated by the safe asset services provided by an e panded stock of common debt an alternative and possibly complementary approach that could also deliver a larger stock of safe assets from the pool of national bonds is provided by the sovereign bond backed securities sbbs proposal this proposal envisages that financial intermediaries whether public or private could bundle a portfolio of national bonds and issue tranched securities with the senior slice constituting a highly safe asset the sbbs proposal has been studied e tensively i chaired an esrb report on it and draft enabling legislation has been prepared by the european commission just as with the blue bond red bond proposal sufficient issuance scale would be required in order to foster the market liquidity needed for the senior bonds to act as highly liquid safe assets finally in relation to the digital euro our updated monetary policy strategy statement also states that introducing a digital euro would support the effectiveness of monetary policy in particular as i outlined in a recent speech a digital euro could help maintain the monetary autonomy of the euro area by ensuring a direct retail role for central bank digital currency can help maintain the monetary autonomy of the euro area by supplementing physical cash with digital cash this would improve resilience by modernising the traditional two tier monetary system whereby both cash and bank deposits can be used as a medium of e change this modernised system would best protect the euro s capacity to serve as the medium of e change and unit of account according to some advocates an alternative approach to adapting the monetary system to a digital age would be to promote stablecoins issued and operated by private sector intermediaries there may be some potentially valid use cases for stablecoins especially in relation to improving the efficiency of cross border payments at least compared to the incumbent global payments infrastructure however stablecoins lack key attributes of central bank money among other limitations as highlighted in the recent annual economic report by the bank for international settlements the supply of stablecoins is not elastic unlike central bank money since their issuance is driven by upfront purchases by customers in contrast central bank money can be issued elastically especially during a crisis by lending to counterparties or through open market operations additionally one to one parity between the value of a stablecoin and the value of a currency cannot be guaranteed under all circumstances such that stablecoins do not protect the singleness of money an effective medium of e change requires that the monetary system and the payments system form a symbiotic ecosystem currently the euro area payments system is highly fragmented along national lines and many customers are dependent on non european card or e wallet providers to make payments across the euro area by mandating acceptance of the digital euro instant network effects would help to unify the currently fragmented market reducing costs for merchants and indirectly also for households such an area wide fast payment system is unlikely to develop in the absence of the area wide payment rails provided by the digital euro infrastructure for these reasons the digital euro is a high priority project for the eurosystem subject to the enabling legislation being adopted

speech deepening our commitment to confronting the climate and nature crises welcome address by frank elderson member of the executive board of the ecb and vice chair of the supervisory board of the ecb at the international monetary fund oedne world bank group eds constituency meeting lu embourg july we live in a dynamic and increasingly comple world e ternal shocks have become more frequent and persistent of late profoundly altering our economies and presenting us with a myriad of challenges over the past few years we have faced the most severe pandemic since the s the most devastating conflict in europe since the s and the worst energy shock since the s meanwhile rising geopolitical tensions are reshaping global trade patterns and prompting a reassessment of broader strategic considerations the rapid digitalisation of our economies brings both comple challenges and immense opportunities and the escalating climate and nature crises pose an e istential threat jeopardising the stability and resilience of our economic system in such an environment we must ensure that our monetary policy strategy remains fit for purpose to this end we revised our strategy in updated it again in and announced the outcome of our most recent e ercise earlier this week monetary policy strategy our monetary policy strategy is firmly rooted in our mandate the ecb s primary objective is to maintain price stability in the euro area this remains the cornerstone of all our actions without prejudice to this primary objective the eurosystem is also obliged to support the general economic policies in the eu the encouraging news is that the fundamentals of the strategy we adopted in have proven resilient even in the face of the shocks and challenges of the past few years consequently the e ercise we have just completed can best be described as an assessment with the core pillars of our strategy remaining unchanged earlier this week we confirmed that price stability is best maintained by targeting an inflation rate of two per cent over the medium term we also recognised that our target is symmetric meaning that our monetary policy action will be appropriately forceful or persistent in response to large sustained deviations of inflation from the target in either direction all tools will remain available in our toolkit acknowledging the increased uncertainty in the inflation environment we reiterated that our monetary policy decisions as well as the evaluation of their proportionality and potential side effects are based on a comprehensive and integrated assessment of all relevant factors the impact of nature degradation on the economy in the monetary policy strategy review the ecb s governing council recognised the significance of climate change for monetary policy this led to the creation of a concrete climate action plan which the ecb and the eurosystem have made significant progress on over the past four years given the close link between climate change and nature degradation the assessment clarified the pivotal role of nature in our ability to fulfil our mandate specifically the governing council committed within its mandate to ensuring that it fully takes into account the implications of both climate change and nature degradation for monetary policy and central banking as i have often emphasised in the past this does not mean we are climate and nature policy makers these policies are set by governments and it is their prerogative to address the climate and nature crises we are climate and nature policy takers at the same time as i will argue in more detail today we have no option but to take the effects of the climate and nature crises into account to deliver on our monetary policy and banking supervision mandates this being said adding the three words and nature degradation to our monetary strategy statement is an important step forward climate refers to the statistical patterns of weather over time a pattern that is visibly changing with major implications for our economy nature on the other hand encompasses the entirety of earth s physical environment including all living organisms it is everything not made by humans so by adding nature degradation we have now committed to considering a vastly more comple set of factors in setting our monetary policy considering the impact of nature degradation on our price stability mandate reflects our commitment to data and evidence based decision making from a central bank perspective nature is an asset it provides many ecosystem services fertile soils pollination timber fish stocks water and clean air to name just a few supporting sustainable economic growth and financial stability if ecosystems deteriorate we are essentially depreciating a vital input into our economy let me draw a parallel with the traditional factors of production when physical or human capital depreciates firms and households respond by investing as it is often far more cost effective to sustain the capital stock than to seek substitutes if alternatives e ist however our collective investment in nature remains vastly insufficient to counteract the current rate of deterioration we are not living off its rents but we are massively eating into nature s capital stock any economist knows that this is unsustainable and everything unsustainable will end being able to put a clear monetary value on nature would help attract and guide investment in preservation and restoration by offering financial rewards while also making it possible to hold those who damage ecosystems financially accountable ecb research has shown that of euro area companies depend on at least one of nature s ecosystem services these services are declining at a faster rate than at any time in human history further research by the ecb and the university of o ford s resilient planet finance lab is looking at the risks more closely first results indicate that of the euro area economy output is at risk from water scarcity alone and over trillion of euro area bank loans are currently e tended to sectors e posed to high water scarcity risk even more worryingly as our models improve and more data becomes available estimates of the economic impact of the climate and nature crises are consistently revised upwards for e ample according to the latest estimates from the network for greening the financial system the potential loss of global gdp if climate action falters is now projected to be three times higher than in earlier assessments from just a few years ago nature preservation and restoration offers no shortcuts rebuilding natural ecosystems is a time intensive process much like developing physical or human capital improvements in soil or water quality typically do not happen overnight and crossing critical tipping points beyond which minor disturbances can trigger irreversible shifts in the state of an ecosystem can effectively render the damage permanent from an economic perspective taking preventive action to avoid lasting harm to the factors of production makes perfect sense it seems particularly prudent since many ecosystem services have the potential to partially recover if not overe ploited for short term economic gains waiting until tipping points are reached would in many cases have far more costly consequences alongside the well documented climate crisis there are thus clear signs that the nature crisis also poses significant risks to our economy these risks could severely affect our economy and complicate our task of maintaining price stability ignoring them would be tantamount to disregarding robust fact based evidence which would be as indefensible as failing to consider any other threat to our price stability target unfortunately given nature s comple ity its interaction with climate change and the current lack of robust data we do not yet have the necessary tools to fully assess the implications of nature degradation for our mandate by including nature degradation in our monetary policy statement we are therefore also implicitly calling for further research and improved data reporting areas we will also contribute to this additional work is crucial to ensure that our monetary policy is set appropriately and in a proportionate manner where we stand and the path ahead the challenge of nature degradation fundamentally stems from a deeply rooted market failure addressing this failure falls primarily within the remit of policymakers not of central banks however from the perspective of our primary and secondary mandate along with further obligations under the eu treaties we have a responsibility to evaluate and consider the economic implications of climate change and nature degradation including both physical and transition risks we are not starting from scratch over the past three years we have conducted and published initial research on nature related risks shedding preliminary light on the severity of the issue we have clarified the legal foundations for actions taken within our mandate and we recently disclosed for the first time the e posure of our corporate portfolios to potential nature related losses our future work plan will delve deeper into the economic financial and monetary policy implications of nature related risks this will complement ongoing efforts to better understand the green transition and the physical impact of climate change however central banks cannot bridge this knowledge and data gap alone in light of the macro criticality of the climate nature crises not only in europe but even more so in developing and emerging economies it is encouraging that a wide range of institutions are developing tools and taking action institutions like the international monetary fund imf play a pivotal role in evaluating the implications of climate change and nature degradation given their mandates to safeguard global macroeconomic and financial stability we welcome the imf s continued efforts to enhance its surveillance activities such as the financial sector assessment programs and article iv consultations as well as its deployment of financing tools like the resilience and sustainability trust to bolster climate resilience and support the transition to low carbon economies conclusion let me conclude we are dedicated to making decisions on the basis of data and evidence therefore within our mandate we remain committed to ensuring that the eurosystem fully takes into account in line with the eu s goals and objectives the implications of climate change and nature degradation for monetary policy and central banking given the uncertainties surrounding these risks continuous scientific input is essential to understanding the impact of the climate and nature crises on our economies active collaboration across institutions and borders is essential to enhance our understanding of the economic implications and to deliver

meeting of june account of the monetary policy meeting of the governing council of the european central bank held in frankfurt am main on tuesday wednesday and thursday june july review of financial economic and monetary developments and policy options financial market developments ms schnabel started her presentation by noting that the narrative in financial markets remained unstable since january market sentiment had swung from strong confidence in us e ceptionalism to expectations of a global recession that had prevailed around the time of the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting on april and then back to investor optimism these developments had been mirrored by sharp swings in euro area asset markets which had now more than recovered from the shock triggered by the us tariff announcement on april on the back of these developments market based measures of inflation compensation had edged up across maturities since the previous monetary policy meeting the priced in inflation path was currently close to over the medium term with a temporary dip below seen for early largely owing to energy related base effects nevertheless expectations regarding ecb monetary policy had not recovered and remained near the levels seen immediately after april financial market volatility had quickly declined after the spike in early april stock market volatility had risen sharply in the euro area and the united states in response to the us tariff announcement on april reaching levels last seen around the time of russia s invasion of ukraine in and the covid pandemic shock in however compared with these shocks volatility had receded much faster returning to post pandemic average levels the receding volatility had been reflected in a sharp rebound in asset prices across market segments in the euro area risk assets had more than recovered from the heavy losses incurred after the april tariff announcement by contrast some us market segments notably the dollar and treasuries had not fully recovered from their losses the largest price increases had been observed for bitcoin and gold two main drivers had led the recovery in euro area risk asset markets and the outperformance of euro area assets relative to us assets the first had been the reassessment of the near term macroeconomic outlook for the euro area since the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting macroeconomic data for both the euro area and the united states had recently surprised on the upside refuting the prospect of a looming recession for both regions the forecasts from consensus economics for euro area real gdp growth in which had been revised down following the april tariff announcement had gradually been revised up again as the prospective economic impact of tariffs was currently seen as less severe than had initially been priced in e pectations for growth in remained well above the forecasts by contrast expectations for growth in the united states in both and had been revised down much more sharply suggesting that economic growth in the united states would be worse hit by tariffs than growth in the euro area the second factor supporting euro area asset prices in recent months had been a growing preference among global investors for broader international diversification away from the united states evidence from equity funds suggested that the euro area was benefiting from global investors international portfolio rebalancing the growing attractiveness of euro denominated assets across market segments had been reflected in recent e change rate developments since the april tariff shock the eur usd e change rate had decoupled from interest rate differentials partly owing to a change in hedging behaviour historically the euro had depreciated against the us dollar when volatility in foreign e change markets increased over the past three months however it had appreciated against the dollar when volatility had risen suggesting that the euro rather than the dollar had recently served as a safe haven currency the outperformance of euro area markets relative to other economies had been most visible in equity prices euro area stocks had continued to outperform not only their us peers but also stock indices of other major economies including the united kingdom switzerland and japan the german da had led the euro area rally and had surpassed its pre tariff levels to reach a new record high driven by expectations of strengthening growth momentum following the announcement of the german fiscal package in march looking at the factors behind euro area stock market developments a divergence could be observed between short term and longer term earnings growth expectations whereas for the next months euro area firms e pected earnings growth had been revised down since the tariff announcement for the next three to five years analysts had continued to revise earnings growth expectations up this could be due to a combination of a short term dampening effect from tariffs and a longer term positive impulse from fiscal policy the recovery in risk sentiment had also been visible in corporate bond markets the spreads of high yielding euro area non financial corporate bonds had more than reversed the spike triggered by the april tariff announcement this suggested that the heightened trade policy uncertainty had not had a lasting impact on the funding conditions of euro area firms despite comparable funding costs on the two sides of the atlantic when taking into account currency risk hedging costs us companies had increasingly turned to euro funding this underlined the increased attractiveness of the euro the resilience of euro area government bond markets had been remarkable the spread between euro area sovereign bonds and overnight inde swap ois rates had narrowed visibly since the april tariff announcement historically during risk off periods gdp weighted euro area government asset swap spreads had tended to widen however during the latest risk off period the reaction of the gdp weighted euro area sovereign yield curve had resembled that of the german bund the traditional safe haven a decomposition of euro area and us ois rates showed that in the united states the rise in longer term ois rates had been driven by a sharp increase in term premia while expectations of policy rate cuts had declined in the euro area the decline in two year ois rates had been entirely driven by expectations of lower policy rates while for longer term rates the term premium had also fallen slightly hence the reassessment of monetary policy expectations had not been the main driver of diverging interest rate dynamics on either side of the atlantic instead the key driver had been a divergence in term premia the recent market developments had had implications for overall financial conditions despite the tightening pressure stemming from the stronger euro e change rate indices of financial conditions had recovered to stand above their pre april levels the decline in euro area real risk free interest rates across the entire yield curve had brought real yields below the level prevailing at the time of the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting inflation compensation had edged up in the euro area since the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting one year forward inflation compensation two years ahead e cluding tobacco currently stood at i e only slightly below the inflation target when accounting for tobacco over the longer term five year forward inflation compensation five years ahead remained well anchored around the fact that near term inflation compensation remained below the levels seen in early could largely be ascribed to the sharp drop in oil prices in spite of the notable easing in financial conditions the fading of financial market volatility the pick up in inflation expectations and positive macroeconomic surprises investors expectations regarding ecb monetary policy had remained broadly unchanged a basis point cut was fully priced in for the present meeting and another rate cut was priced in by the end of the year with some uncertainty regarding the timing hence expectations for ecb rates had proven relatively insensitive to the recovery in other market segments the global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area mr lane started by noting that headline inflation had declined to in may from in april energy inflation had been unchanged at in may food inflation had edged up to from while goods inflation had been stable at in may and services inflation had declined to in may from in april most measures of underlying inflation suggested that in the medium term inflation would settle at around the target on a sustained basis in part as a result of the continuing moderation in wage growth the annual growth rate of negotiated wages had fallen to in the first quarter of from in the fourth quarter of forward looking wage trackers continued to point to an easing in negotiated wage growth the eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresaw a deceleration in the annual growth rate of compensation per employee from in to in and to in and the consumer e pectations survey also pointed to moderating wage pressures the short term outlook for headline inflation had been revised down owing to lower energy prices and the stronger euro this was supported by market based inflation compensation measures the euro had appreciated strongly since early march but had moved broadly sideways over the past few weeks since the april governing council meeting the euro had strengthened slightly against the us dollar and had depreciated in nominal effective terms compared with the march projections oil prices and oil futures had decreased substantially as the euro had appreciated the decline in oil prices in euro terms had become even larger than in us dollar terms gas prices and gas futures were also at much lower levels than at the time of the march projections according to the baseline in the june staff projections headline inflation as measured by the harmonised inde of consumer prices hicp was e pected to average in in and in relative to the march projections inflation had been revised down by percentage points for both and and was unchanged for headline inflation was e pected to remain below the target for the next one and a half years the downward revisions mainly reflected lower energy price assumptions as well as a stronger euro the projected increase in inflation in incorporated an e pected temporary upward impact from climate related fiscal measures namely the new eu emissions trading system ets in the june baseline projections core inflation hicp inflation e cluding energy and food was e pected to average in and in both and the results of the latest survey of monetary analysts were broadly in line with the june projections for headline inflation in and but showed a notably less pronounced undershoot for most measures of longer term inflation expectations remained at around the target which supported the sustainable return of inflation to target at the same time markets were pricing in an e tended phase of below target inflation with the one year forward inflation linked swap rate two years ahead and the one year forward rate three years ahead averaging the frontloading of imports in anticipation of higher tariffs had contributed to stronger than e pected global trade growth in the first quarter of the year however high frequency data pointed to a significant slowdown of trade in may e cluding the euro area global gdp growth had moderated to in the first quarter down from in the fourth quarter of the global manufacturing purchasing managers inde pmi e cluding the euro area continued to signal stagnation edging down to in may from in april the forward looking pmi for new manufacturing orders remained below the neutral threshold of compared with the march projections euro area foreign demand had been revised down by percentage points for and by percentage points for growth in euro area foreign demand was e pected to decline to in and in before recovering to in while eurostat s most recent flash estimate suggested that the euro area economy had grown by in the first quarter an aggregation of available country data pointed to a growth rate of domestic demand e ports and inventories should all have made a positive contribution to the first quarter outturn economic activity had likely benefited from frontloading in anticipation of trade frictions this was supported by anecdotal evidence from the latest non financial business sector dialogue held in may and by particularly strong e port and industrial production growth in some euro area countries in march on the supply side value added in manufacturing appeared to have contributed to gdp growth more than services for the first time since the fourth quarter of survey data pointed to weaker euro area growth in the second quarter amid elevated uncertainty uncertainty was also affecting consumer confidence the consumer e pectations survey confidence indicator had dropped in april falling to its lowest level since russia s invasion of ukraine mainly because higher income households were more responsive to changing economic conditions a saving rate indicator based on the same survey had also increased in annual terms for the first time since october likely reflecting precautionary motives for saving the labour market remained robust according to eurostat s flash estimate employment had increased by in the first quarter of from in the fourth quarter of the unemployment rate had remained broadly unchanged since october and had stood at a record low of in april at the same time demand for labour continued to moderate gradually as reflected in a decline in the job vacancy rate and subdued employment pmis workers perceptions of the labour market and of probabilities of finding a job had also weakened according to the latest consumer e pectations survey trade tensions and elevated uncertainty had clouded the outlook for the euro area economy greater uncertainty was e pected to weigh on investment higher tariffs and the recent appreciation of the euro should weigh on e ports despite these headwinds conditions remained in place for the euro area economy to strengthen over time in particular a strong labour market rising real wages robust private sector balance sheets and less restrictive financing conditions following the governing council s past interest rate cuts should help the economy withstand the fallout from a volatile global environment in addition a rebound in foreign demand later in the projection horizon and the recently announced fiscal support measures were e pected to bolster growth over the medium term in the june projections the fiscal deficit was now e pected to be in in and in the higher deficit path was mostly due to the additional fiscal package related to higher defence and infrastructure spending in germany the june projections foresaw annual average real gdp growth of in in and in relative to the march projections the outlook for gdp growth was unchanged for and and had been revised down by percentage points for the unrevised growth projection for reflected a stronger than e pected first quarter combined with weaker prospects for the remainder of the year in the current conte t of high uncertainty eurosystem staff had also assessed how different trade policies and the level of uncertainty surrounding these policies could affect growth and inflation under some alternative illustrative scenarios which would be published with the staff projections on the ecb s website if the trade tensions were to escalate further over the coming months staff would e pect growth and inflation to be below their baseline projections by contrast if the trade tensions were resolved with a benign outcome staff would e pect growth and to a lesser e tent inflation to be higher than in the baseline projections turning to monetary and financial conditions risk free interest rates had remained broadly unchanged since the april meeting equity prices had risen and corporate bond spreads had narrowed in response to better trade news while global risk sentiment had improved the euro had stayed close to the level it had reached as a result of the deepening of trade and financial tensions in april at the same time sentiment in financial markets remained fragile especially as suspensions of higher us tariff rates were set to e pire starting in early july lower policy rates continued to be transmitted to lending conditions for firms and households the average interest rate on new loans to firms had declined to in april from in march with the cost of issuing market based debt unchanged at consistent with these patterns bank lending to firms had continued to strengthen gradually growing by an annual rate of in april after in march while corporate bond issuance had been subdued the average interest rate on new mortgages had stayed at in april while growth in mortgage lending had increased to from in march annual growth in broad money as measured by m had picked up in april to from in march monetary policy considerations and policy options in summary inflation was currently at around the target while this in part reflected falling energy prices most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at this level on a sustained basis in the medium term this medium term outlook was underpinned by the e pected continuing moderation in services inflation as wage growth decelerated the current indications were that rising barriers to global trade would likely have a disinflationary impact on the euro area in and as reflected in the june baseline and the staff scenarios however the possibility that a deterioration in trade relations would put upward pressure on inflation through supply chain disruptions required careful ongoing monitoring under the baseline only a limited revision was seen to the path of gdp growth but the headwinds to activity would be stronger under the severe scenario broadly speaking monetary transmission was proceeding smoothly although high uncertainty reduced its strength based on this assessment mr lane proposed lowering the three key ecb interest rates by basis points taking the deposit facility rate to the june projections were conditioned on a rate path that included a one quarter of a percentage point reduction in the deposit facility rate in june by supporting the pricing pressure needed to generate target consistent inflation in the medium term this cut would help ensure that the projected deviation of inflation below the target in remained temporary and did not turn into a longer term deviation by demonstrating that the governing council was determined to make sure that inflation returned to target in the medium term the rate reduction would help underpin inflation expectations and avoid an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions the proposal was also robust across the different trade policy scenarios prepared by staff governing council s discussion and monetary policy decisions economic monetary and financial analyses on the global environment growth in the world economy outside the euro area was e pected to slow in and compared with this slowdown reflected developments in the united states although china would also be affected and would result in slower growth in euro area foreign demand these developments were seen to stem mainly from trade policy measures enacted by the us administration and reactions from china and other countries members underlined that the outlook for the global economy remained highly uncertain elevated trade uncertainty was likely to prevail for some time and could broaden and intensify beyond the most recent announcements of tariffs on steel and aluminium further tariffs could increase trade tensions as well as the likelihood of retaliatory actions and the prospect of non linear effects as retaliation would increasingly affect intermediate goods while high frequency trackers of global economic activity and trade had remained relatively resilient in the first quarter of partly reflecting frontloading indicators for april and may already suggested some slowdown the euro had appreciated in nominal effective terms since the march projection e ercise although not by as much as it had strengthened against the us dollar another noteworthy development was the sharp decline in energy commodity prices with both crude oil and natural gas prices now e pected to be substantially lower than foreseen in the march projections on the basis of futures prices developments in energy prices and the e change rate were seen as the main drivers of the dynamics of euro area headline inflation at present members e tensively discussed the trade scenarios prepared by eurosystem staff in the conte t of the june projection e ercise such scenarios should assist in identifying the relevant channels at work and could provide a quantification of the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty on growth the labour market and inflation in conjunction with regular sensitivity analyses the baseline assumption of the june projection e ercise was that tariffs would remain at the may level over the projection horizon and that uncertainty would remain elevated though gradually declining recognising the high level of uncertainty currently surrounding us trade policies two alternative scenarios had been considered for illustrative purposes one was a mild scenario of lower tariffs incorporating the zero for zero tariff proposal for industrial goods put forward by the european commission and a faster reduction in trade policy uncertainty the other was a severe scenario which assumed that tariffs would revert to the higher levels announced in april and also included retaliation by the eu with trade policy uncertainty remaining elevated in the first instance it was underlined that the probability that could be attached to the baseline projection materialising was lower than in normal times accordingly a higher probability had to be attached to alternative possible outcomes including potential non linearities entailed in jumping from one scenario to another and the baseline provided less guidance than usual mi ed views were e pressed however on the likelihood of the scenarios and on which would be the most relevant channels on the one hand the mild scenario was regarded as useful to demonstrate the benefits of freeing trade rather than restricting it however at the current juncture there was relatively little confidence that it would materialise regarding the severe scenario the discussion did not centre on its degree of severity but rather on whether it adequately captured the possible adverse ramifications of substantially higher tariffs one source of additional stress was related to dislocations in financial markets moreover downward pressure on inflation could be amplified if countries with overcapacity rerouted their e ports to the euro area more pressure could come from energy prices falling further and the euro appreciating more strongly it was remarked that in all the scenarios the main impact on activity and inflation appeared to stem from higher policy uncertainty rather than from the direct impact of higher tariffs a third focus of the discussion regarded possible adverse supply side effects the argument was made that the scenarios presented in the staff projections were likely to underestimate the upside risks to inflation because tariffs were modelled as a negative demand shock while supply side effects were not taken into account while it was noted that thus far no significant broad based supply side disturbances had materialised restrictions on trade in rare earths were cited as an e ample of adverse supply chain effects that had already occurred moreover the e periences after the pandemic and after russia s unjustified invasion of ukraine served as cautionary reminders that supply side effects if and when they occurred could be non linear in nature and impact in this respect potential short term supply chain disruptions needed to be distinguished from longer term trends such as deglobalisation reference was made to an occasional paper published in december on trade fragmentation entitled navigating a fragmenting global trading system insights for central banks which had considered the implications of a splitting of trading blocs between the east and the west while such detailed sectoral analysis could serve as a useful satellite model it was not part of the standard macroeconomic toolkit underpinning the projections at the same time it was noted that large supply side effects from trade fragmentation could themselves trigger negative demand effects against this background it was argued that retaliatory tariffs and non linear effects of tariffs on the supply side of the economy including through structural disruption and fragmentation of global supply chains might spur inflationary pressures in particular inflation could be higher than in the baseline in the short run if the eu took retaliatory measures following an escalation of the tariff war by the united states and if tariffs were imposed on products that were not easily substitutable such as intermediate goods in such a scenario tariffs and countermeasures could ripple through the global economy via global supply chains firms suffering from rising costs of imported inputs would over time likely pass these costs on to consumers as the previous erosion of profit margins made cost absorption difficult over the longer term a reconfiguration of global supply chains would probably make production less efficient thereby reversing earlier gains from globalisation as a result the inflationary effects of tariffs on the supply side could outweigh the disinflationary pressure from reduced foreign demand and therefore pose upside risks to the medium term inflation outlook with regard to euro area activity the economy had proven more resilient in the first quarter of than had been e pected but the outlook remained challenging preliminary estimates of euro area real gdp growth in the first quarter suggested that it had not only been stronger than previously anticipated but also broader based and recent updates based on the aggregation of selected available country data suggested that there could be a further upward revision frontloading of activity and trade ahead of prospective tariffs had likely played a significant role in the stronger than e pected outturn in the first quarter but the broad based e pansion was a positive signal with data suggesting growth in most demand components including private consumption and investment in particular attention was drawn to the likely positive contribution from investment which had been e pected to be more adversely affected by trade policy uncertainty it was also felt that the underlying fundamentals of the euro area were in a good state and would support economic growth in the period ahead notably higher real incomes and the robust labour market would allow households to spend more rising government investment in infrastructure and defence would also support growth particularly in and these solid foundations for domestic demand should help to make the euro area economy more resilient to e ternal shocks at the same time economic growth was e pected to be more subdued in the second and third quarters of this assessment reflected in part the assumed unwinding of the frontloading that had occurred in the first quarter the implementation of some of the previously announced trade restrictions and ongoing uncertainty about future trade policies indeed recent real time indicators for the second quarter appeared to confirm the e pected slowdown composite pmi data for april and may pointed to a moderation both in current activity and in more forward looking indicators such as new orders it was noted that a novel feature of the latest survey data was that manufacturing indicators were above those for services in fact the manufacturing sector continued to show signs of a recovery in spite of trade policy uncertainty with the manufacturing pmi standing at its highest level since august the pmis for manufacturing output and new orders had been in e pansionary territory for three months in a row and expectations regarding future output were at their highest level for more than three years while this was viewed as a positive development it partly reflected a temporary boost to manufacturing stemming from frontloading of e ports which masked potential headwinds for e porting firms in the months ahead that would be further reinforced by a stronger euro while there was considerable volatility in e port developments at present the e pected profile over the entire projection horizon had been revised down substantially in the past two projection e ercises in addition ongoing high uncertainty and trade policy unpredictability were e pected to weigh on investment furthermore the decline in services indicators was suggestive of the toll that trade policy uncertainty was taking on economic sentiment more broadly overall estimates for gdp growth in the near term suggested a significant slowdown in growth dynamics and pointed to broadly flat economic activity in the middle of the year looking ahead broad agreement was e pressed with the june eurosystem staff projections for growth although it was felt that the outlook was more clouded than usual as a result of current trade policy developments it was noted that stronger than previously e pected growth around the turn of the year had provided a marked boost to the annual growth figure with staff e pecting an average of for however it was observed that the unrevised projection for as a whole concealed a stronger than previously anticipated start to the year but a weaker than previously projected middle part of the year thus the e pected pick up in growth to in also masked an anticipated slowdown in the middle of staff e pected growth to increase further to in some scepticism was e pressed regarding the much stronger quarterly growth rates foreseen for following essentially flat quarterly growth for the remainder of all in all it was felt that robust labour markets and rising real wages provided reasonable grounds for optimism regarding the e pected pick up in growth private sector balance sheets were seen to be in good shape and part of the increase in activity foreseen for and was driven by expectations of increased government investment in infrastructure and defence moreover the e pected recovery in consumption was made more likely by the fact that the projections foresaw only a relatively gradual decline in the household saving rate which was e pected to remain relatively high compared with the pre pandemic period at the same time it was noted that the decline in the household saving rate factored into the projections might not materialise in the current environment of elevated trade policy uncertainty similarly scepticism was e pressed regarding the projected rebound in housing investment given that mortgage rates could be e pected to increase in line with higher long term interest rates more generally caution was e pressed about the composition of the e pected pick up in activity in recent years higher public e penditure had to some e tent masked weakness in private sector activity looking ahead given the economic and political constraints public investment could turn out to be lower or less powerful in boosting economic growth than assumed in the baseline even when abstracting from the lack of sufficient fiscal space in a number of jurisdictions labour markets continued to represent a bright spot for the euro area economy and contributed to its resilience in the current environment employment continued to grow and april data indicated that the unemployment rate at was at its lowest level since the launch of the euro the positive signals from labour markets and growth in real wages together with more favourable financing conditions gave grounds for confidence that the euro area economy could weather the current trade policy storm and resume a growth path once conditions became more stable however attention was also drawn to some indications of a gradual softening in labour demand this was evident in particular in the decline in job vacancy rates in addition while the manufacturing employment pmi indicated less negative developments the services sector indicator had declined in april and may lastly consumer surveys suggested that workers expectations for the unemployment rate had deteriorated and unemployed workers expectations of finding a job had fallen with regard to fiscal and structural policies it was argued that the boost to spending on infrastructure and defence thus far seen as mainly concentrated in the largest euro area economy would broadly offset the impact on activity from ongoing trade tensions however the time profile of the effects was seen to differ between the two shocks against this background members considered that the risks to economic growth remained tilted to the downside the main downside risks included a possible further escalation in global trade tensions and associated uncertainties which could lower euro area growth by dampening e ports and dragging down investment and consumption furthermore it was noted that a deterioration in financial market sentiment could lead to tighter financing conditions and greater risk aversion and make firms and households less willing to invest and consume in addition geopolitical tensions such as russia s unjustified war against ukraine and the tragic conflict in the middle east remained a major source of uncertainty on the other hand it was noted that if trade and geopolitical tensions were resolved swiftly this could lift sentiment and spur activity a further increase in defence and infrastructure spending together with productivity enhancing reforms would also add to growth in the conte t of structural and fiscal policies it was felt that while the current geopolitical situation posed challenges to the euro area economy it also offered opportunities however these opportunities would only be realised if quick and decisive actions were taken by economic policymakers it was noted that monetary policy had delivered bringing inflation back to target despite the unprecedented shocks and challenges it was observed that now was the time for other actors in particular the european commission and national governments to step up quickly particularly as the window of opportunity was likely to be limited this included implementing the recommendations in the reports by mario draghi and enrico letta and projects under the european savings and investment union these measures would not only bring benefits in their own right but could also strengthen the international role of the euro and enhance the resilience of the euro area economy more broadly it was widely underlined that the present geopolitical environment made it even more urgent for fiscal and structural policies to make the euro area economy more productive competitive and resilient in particular it was considered that the european commission s competitiveness compass provided a concrete roadmap for action and its proposals including on simplification should be swiftly adopted this included completing the savings and investment union following a clear and ambitious timetable it was also important to rapidly establish the legislative framework to prepare the ground for the potential introduction of a digital euro governments should ensure sustainable public finances in line with the eu s economic governance framework while prioritising essential growth enhancing structural reforms and strategic investment with regard to price developments members largely concurred with the assessment presented by mr lane the fact that the latest release showed that headline inflation at in may was back in line with the target was widely welcomed this flash estimate released on tuesday june well after the cut off point for the june projections showed a noticeable decline in services inflation to in may from in april the drop was reassuring as it supported the argument that the timing of easter and its effect on travel related air transport and package holiday prices had been behind the percentage point uptick in services inflation in april the rate of increase in non energy industrial goods prices had remained contained at in may accordingly core inflation had decreased to from in april more than offsetting the percentage point increase observed in that month some concern was e pressed about the increase in food price inflation to in may from in april but it was also noted that international food commodity prices had decreased most recently it was widely acknowledged that consumer energy prices which had declined by year on year in may were continuing to pull down the headline rate of inflation and were the key drivers of the downward revision of the inflation profile in the june projections compared with the march projections looking ahead according to the june projections headline inflation was set to average in in and in it was underlined that the downward revisions compared with the march projections by percentage points for both and mainly reflected lower assumptions for energy prices and a stronger euro the projections for core inflation which was e pected to average in and in and were broadly unchanged from the march projections while energy prices and e change rates were likely to lead to headline inflation undershooting the target for some time inflation dynamics would over the medium term increasingly be driven by the effects of fiscal policy hence headline inflation was on target for though this was partly due to a sizeable contribution from the implementation of ets overall it was considered that the euro area was currently in a good place as far as inflation was concerned there was increasing confidence that most measures of underlying inflation were consistent with inflation settling at around the medium term target on a sustained basis even as domestic inflation remained high while wage growth remained elevated there was broad agreement that wages were set to moderate visibly furthermore profits were assessed to be partially buffering the impact of wage growth on inflation however it was also remarked that firms profit margins had been squeezed for some time which increased the likelihood of cost push shocks being passed through to prices while short term consumer inflation expectations had edged up in april this likely reflected the impact of news about trade tensions most measures of longer term inflation expectations continued to stand at around regarding wage developments it was noted that both hard data and survey data suggested that moderation was ongoing this was supported particularly by incoming data on negotiated wages and available country data on compensation per employee furthermore the ecb wage tracker pointed to a further easing of negotiated wage growth in while the staff projections saw wage growth falling below in and it was noted that the projections for the rate of increase in compensation per employee in both and would see wages rising just at the rate of inflation plus trend productivity growth of it was commented however that compensation per employee in the first quarter of had surprised on the upside and that the decline in negotiated wage indicators was partly driven by one off payments turning to the governing council s risk assessment it was considered that the outlook for euro area inflation was more uncertain than usual as a result of the volatile global trade policy environment falling energy prices and a stronger euro could put further downward pressure on inflation this could be reinforced if higher tariffs led to lower demand for euro area e ports and to countries with overcapacity rerouting their e ports to the euro area trade tensions could lead to greater volatility and risk aversion in financial markets which would weigh on domestic demand and would thereby also lower inflation by contrast a fragmentation of global supply chains could raise inflation by pushing up import prices and adding to capacity constraints in the domestic economy a boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation over the medium term e treme weather events and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly could drive up food prices by more than e pected regarding the trade scenarios a key issue in the risk assessment for inflation was the relative roles of demand side and supply side effects it was broadly felt that the potential demand side effects of tariffs were relatively well understood in the conte t of standard models where they were typically treated as equivalent to a ta on cross border goods and services at the same time uncertainties remained about the magnitude of these demand factors with milder or more severe effects relative to the baseline both judged as being plausible it was also argued that growth and sentiment had remained resilient despite e traordinarily high uncertainty this suggested that the persistence of uncertainty or its effects on growth and inflation in the severe scenario might be overstated especially given the current positive confidence effect in the euro area visible in financial markets the relatively small impact on inflation even in the severe scenario which pushed gdp growth to in suggested that the downside risks to inflation were limited furthermore it was noted that while the trade policy scenarios and sensitivity analyses resulted in some variation in numbers depending on tariff assumptions the effects were dwarfed by the impact of the assumptions for energy prices and the e change rate which were common to all scenarios in this conte t it was suggested that the impact of the e change rate on inflation might be more muted than projected first the high level of the use of the euro as an invoicing currency limited the impact of the e change rate on inflation second the pass through from e change rate changes to inflation might be asymmetric i e weaker in the case of an appreciation as firms sought to boost their compressed profit margins moreover the analysis might be unable to properly capture the positive impact of higher confidence in the euro area of which the stronger euro e change rate was just one reflection the positive effects had also been visible in sovereign bond markets with lower spreads and reduced term premia bringing down financing costs for sovereigns and firms on potential supply side effects the e periences in the aftermath of the pandemic and russia s unjustified invasion of ukraine were mentioned as pointing to risks of strong adverse supply side effects which could be non linear and appear quickly in this conte t it was noted that supply side indicators particularly concerning supply chains and potential bottlenecks were being monitored and tracked very closely by staff however sufficient evidence had not so far been collected to substantiate these factors playing a major role moreover attention was also drawn to potential disinflationary supply side effects for e ample arising from trade diversion from china however it was suggested that this effect was quantitatively limited moreover it was argued that any large scale trade diversion could prompt countermeasures from the eu as was already the case in specific instances which should attenuate disinflationary pressures there was some discussion of whether energy commodity prices were weak because of demand or supply effects it was noted that this had implications for the inflation risk assessment if the weakness was primarily due to demand effects then inflation risks were tied to the risks to economic activity and going in the same direction if the weakness was due to supply effects as suggested by staff analysis in particular to oil production increases then risks from energy prices could go in the opposite direction thus if the changes to oil production were reversed energy prices could surprise on the upside even if economic activity surprised on the downside turning to the monetary and financial analysis risk free interest rates had remained broadly unchanged since the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting on april market participants were fully pricing in a basis point rate cut at the current meeting broader financial conditions had eased in the euro area since the april meeting with equity prices fully recovering their previous losses over the past month corporate bond spreads narrowing and sovereign bond spreads declining to levels not seen for a long time this was in response to more positive news about global trade policies an improvement in global risk sentiment and higher confidence in the euro area at the same time it was highlighted that there had still been significant negative news about global trade policies over recent weeks in this conte t it was argued that market participants might have become slightly over optimistic as they had become more accustomed both to negative news and to policy reversals from the united states and this could pose risks it was seen as noteworthy that overall financial conditions had continued to ease recently without markets e pecting a substantial further reduction in policy rates it was also contended that the fiscal package in the euro area s largest economy might push up the neutral rate of interest suggesting that the recent loosening of financial conditions was even more significant when assessed against this rate benchmark the euro had stayed close to the level it had reached following the announcement of the german fiscal package in march and the deepening trade and financial tensions in april in this conte t structural factors could be influencing e change rates possibly including greater confidence in the euro area and an adverse outlook for us fiscal policies these developments could e plain us dollar weakness despite the recent increase in long term government bond yields in the united states and their decline in the euro area portfolio managers had also started to rebalance away from the us dollar and us assets if this were to continue the euro might e perience further appreciation pressures in addition there had recently been a significant increase in the issuance of reverse yankee bonds euro denominated bonds issued by companies based outside the euro area and in particular in the united states partly reflecting wider yield differentials in the euro area the transmission of past interest rate cuts continued to make corporate borrowing less e pensive overall and interest rates on deposits were also still declining at the same time lending rates were flattening out the average interest rate on new loans to firms had declined to in april from in march while the cost of issuing market based debt had been unchanged at the average interest rate on new mortgages had stayed at in april but was e pected to increase in the near future owing to higher long term yields since the cut off date for the march projections bank lending to firms had continued to strengthen gradually growing by an annual rate of in april after in march while corporate bond issuance had been subdued the growth in mortgage lending had increased to the sustained recovery in credit was welcome with the annual growth in credit to both firms and households now at its highest level since june it was remarked that credit growth had seemingly become resilient even though the recovery had started from on average higher interest rates than in previous cycles households demand for mortgages had continued to increase swiftly according to the bank lending survey this seemed to be a natural consequence of interest rates on housing loans being already below their historical average with mortgage demand much more sensitive to interest rates than corporate loan demand with interest rates on corporate loans still declining although remaining above their historical average the latest survey on the access to finance of enterprises had also shown that firms did not see access to finance as an obstacle to borrowing as loan applications had increased and many companies not applying for loans appeared to have sufficient internal funds at the same time loan demand was picking up from still subdued levels and credit growth remained fairly muted by historical standards furthermore elevated uncertainty due to trade tensions and geopolitical risks was still not fully reflected in the available hard data it was also observed that by reducing e ternal competitiveness the recent appreciation of the euro could affect e porters credit demand in their biannual e change on the links between monetary policy and financial stability members concurred that while euro area banks had remained resilient broader financial stability risks remained elevated in particular owing to highly uncertain and volatile global trade policies risks in global sovereign bond markets were also discussed and it was noted that the euro area sovereign bond market was proving more resilient than had been the case for a long time macroprudential policy remained the first line of defence against the build up of financial vulnerabilities enhancing resilience and preserving macroprudential space monetary policy stance and policy considerations turning to the monetary policy stance members assessed the data that had become available since the last monetary policy meeting in accordance with the three main elements that the governing council had communicated in as shaping its reaction function these comprised i the implications of the incoming economic and financial data for the inflation outlook ii the dynamics of underlying inflation and iii the strength of monetary policy transmission starting with the inflation outlook members welcomed the fact that headline inflation was currently at around the medium term target and that this had occurred earlier than previously anticipated as a result of lower energy prices and a stronger e change rate lower energy prices and a stronger euro would continue to put downward pressure on inflation in the near term with inflation projected to fall below the target in before returning to target in most measures of longer term inflation expectations continued to stand at around which also supported the stabilisation of inflation around the target members discussed the e tent to which the projected temporary undershooting of the inflation target was a concern concerns were e pressed that following the downward revisions to annual inflation for both and inflation was projected to be below the target for months which could be considered as e tending into the medium term it was argued that would be an important year because below target inflation expectations could become embedded in wage negotiations and lead to downside second round effects it was also contended that the risk of undershooting the target for a prolonged period was due not only to energy prices and the e change rate but also to weak demand and the e pected slowdown in wage growth in addition the timing and effects of fiscal e pansion remained uncertain it was important to keep in mind that the inflation undershoot remaining temporary was conditional on an appropriate setting of monetary policy at the same time it was highlighted that despite the undershooting of the target in the relatively near term which was partly due to sizeable energy base effects amplified by the appreciation of the euro from a medium term perspective inflation was set to remain broadly at around in view of this it was important not to overemphasise the downside deviation especially since it was mainly due to volatile e ternal factors which could easily reverse therefore the risk of a sustained undershooting of the inflation target was seen as limited unless there was a sharp deterioration in labour market conditions the return of inflation to target would be supported by the likely emergence of upside pressures on inflation especially from fiscal policy so as long as the projected undershoot did not become more pronounced or affect the return to target in and provided that inflation expectations remained anchored the soft inflation figures foreseen in the near term should be manageable turning to underlying inflation members concurred that most measures suggested that inflation would settle at around the medium term target on a sustained basis while core inflation remained elevated it was projected to decline to in and remain there in this was seen as consistent with the stabilisation of inflation at target some other measures of underlying inflation including domestic inflation were still elevated but were also moving in the right direction the projected decline in underlying inflation was e pected to be supported by further deceleration in wage growth and a reduction in services inflation although the pace of wage growth was still strong it had continued to moderate visibly as indicated by incoming data on negotiated wages and available country data on compensation per employee and profits were also partially buffering its impact on inflation looking ahead underlying inflation could come under further downward pressure if the projected near term undershooting of headline inflation lowered wage expectations and also because large shocks to energy prices typically percolated across the economy at the same time fiscal policy and tariffs had the potential to generate new upward pressure on underlying inflation over the medium term finally transmission of monetary policy continued to be smooth looking back over a long period it was observed that robust and data driven monetary policy had made a significant contribution to bringing inflation back to the target the removal of monetary restriction over the past year had also been timely in helping to ensure that inflation would stabilise sustainably at around the target in the period ahead its transmission to lending rates had been effective contributing to easier financing conditions and supporting credit growth some of the transmission from rate cuts remained in the pipeline and would continue to provide support to the economy helping consumers and firms withstand the fallout from the volatile global environment concerns that increased uncertainty and a volatile market response to the trade tensions in april would have a tightening impact on financing conditions had eased on the contrary financial frictions appeared low in the euro area with limited risk premia and declining term premia supporting transmission of the monetary impulse and bringing down financing costs for sovereign and corporate borrowers at the same time elevated uncertainty could weaken the transmission mechanism of monetary policy possibly because of the option value of deferring consumption and investment decisions in such an environment there also remained a risk that a deterioration in financial market sentiment could lead to tighter financing conditions and greater risk aversion and make firms and households less willing to invest and consume it was contended that after seven rate cuts interest rates were now firmly in neutral territory and possibly already in accommodative territory it was argued that this was also suggested by the upturn in credit growth and by the bank lending survey however it was highlighted that although banks were lending more and demand for loans was rising credit origination remained at subdued levels when compared with a range of benchmarks based on past regularities investment also remained weak compared with historical benchmarks monetary policy decisions and communication against this background almost all members supported the proposal made by mr lane to lower the three key ecb interest rates by basis points lowering the deposit facility rate the rate through which the governing council steered the monetary policy stance was justified by its updated assessment of the inflation outlook the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission a further reduction in interest rates was seen as warranted to protect the medium term inflation target beyond in an environment in which inflation was currently at target but projected to fall below it for a temporary period in this conte t it was recalled that the staff projections were conditioned on a market curve that embedded a basis point rate cut in june and about basis points of cuts in total by the end of it was also noted that the staff scenarios and sensitivity analyses generally pointed to inflation being below the target in moreover while inflation was consistent with the target the growth projection for had been revised slightly downwards the proposed reduction in policy rates should be seen as aiming to protect the on target projection for it should ensure that the temporary undershoot in headline inflation did not become prolonged in a conte t in which further disinflation in core measures was e pected the growth outlook remained relatively weak and spare capacity in manufacturing made it unlikely that slightly faster growth would translate into immediate inflationary pressures it was argued that cutting interest rates by basis points at the current meeting would leave rates in broadly neutral territory this would keep the governing council well positioned to navigate the high uncertainty that lay ahead while affording full optionality for future meetings to manage two sided inflation risks across a wide range of scenarios by contrast keeping interest rates at their current levels could increase the risk of undershooting the inflation target in and at the same time a few members saw a case for keeping interest rates at their current levels the near term temporary inflation undershoot should be looked through since it was mostly due to volatile factors such as lower energy prices and a stronger e change rate which could easily reverse it remained to be seen whether and to what e tent these factors would translate into lower core inflation it was necessary to avoid reacting e cessively to volatility in headline inflation at a time when domestic inflation remained high and there might be new upward pressure on underlying inflation over the medium term from both tariffs and fiscal policy this was especially the case after a period of above target inflation and when the inflation expectations of firms and households were still above target with short term consumer inflation expectations having increased recently and inflation expectations standing above across horizons this implied that there was a very limited risk of a downward unanchoring of inflation expectations there were also several reasons why the projections and scenarios might be underestimating medium term inflationary pressures there could be upside risks from underlying inflation in part because services inflation remained above levels compatible with a sustained return to the inflation target the e ceptional uncertainty relating to trade tensions had reduced confidence in the baseline projections and meant that there could be value in waiting to see how the trade war unfolded in addition although growth was only picking up gradually and there were risks to the downside the probability of a recession was currently quite low and interest rates were already low enough not to hold back economic growth the point was made that the labour market had proven very resilient with the unemployment rate at a historical low and employment e panding despite prospects of higher tariffs given the recent re flattening of the phillips curve the risk of a sustained undershooting of the inflation target was seen as limited in the absence of a sharp deterioration of labour market conditions it was also argued that adopting an accommodative monetary policy stance would not be appropriate in any case the evidence suggested that such accommodation would not be very effective in an environment of high uncertainty in this conte t it was also contended that interest rates could already be in accommodative territory an argument was made that the neutral rate of interest had undergone a shift since early increasing substantially and it was still likely to increase further owing to fiscal e pansion and the shift from a dearth of safe assets to a government bond glut however it was pointed out that while e pected policy rates and the term premium had increased in there was an open question as to the e tent to which that reflected an increase in the neutral rate of interest or simply the removal of e traordinary policy accommodation it was argued that the recent weakness in investment strength of savings and still subdued credit volumes suggested that there probably had not been a significant increase in the neutral rate of interest with these considerations in mind these members e pressed an initial preference for keeping interest rates unchanged to allow more time to analyse the current situation and detect any sustained inflationary or disinflationary pressures however in light of the preceding discussion they ultimately e pressed readiness to join the consensus with the e ception of one member who upheld a dissenting view looking ahead members reiterated that the governing council remained determined to ensure that inflation would stabilise sustainably at its medium term target the governing council s interest rate decisions would continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission e ceptional uncertainty also underscored the importance of following a data dependent and meeting by meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance given the pervasive uncertainty the possibility of rapid changes in the economic environment and the risk of shocks to inflation in both directions it was important for the governing council to retain a two sided perspective and avoid tying its hands ahead of any future meeting the nature and focus of data dependence might need to evolve to place more emphasis on indicators speaking to future developments this possibly suggested placing a greater premium on e amining high frequency data financial market data survey data and soft information such as from corporate contacts for e ample to help gauge any supply chain problems it was also underlined that scenarios would continue to be important in helping to assess and convey uncertainty against this background it was maintained that the rate path needed to remain consistent with meeting the target over the medium term and that agility would be vital given the elevated uncertainty at the same time the view was e pressed that monetary policy should become less reactive to incoming data in particular only large shocks would imply the need for a monetary policy response as the governing council should be willing to tolerate moderate deviations from target as long as inflation expectations were anchored turning to communication members concurred that in view of the latest inflation developments and projections it was time to refer to inflation as being currently at around the governing council s medium term target rather than saying that the disinflation process was well on track it was also agreed that e ternal communication should make clear that the alternative scenarios to be published were prepared by staff that they were illustrative in that they only represented a subset of alternative possibilities that they only assessed some of the mechanisms by which different trade policies could affect growth and inflation and that their outcomes were conditional on the assumptions used taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members upon a proposal by the president the governing council took the monetary policy decisions as set out in the monetary policy press release the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the monetary policy statement which the president

speech strategy assessment lessons learned introductory speech by christine lagarde president of the ecb at the opening reception of the ecb forum on central banking adapting to change macroeconomic shifts and policy responses sintra june as nietzsche once observed it is our future that lays down the law of our today when we last reviewed our strategy four years ago our thinking was shaped quite naturally by the recent past a decade of too low inflation compounded by the pandemic but as nietzsche warned there is a danger in letting the past dominate our thinking sometimes it is the future still dimly understood that is already shaping our present and soon after that review the world changed in ways we had not foreseen the reopening of our economies after the pandemic brought about major sectoral shifts russia s invasion of ukraine triggered a fundamental shift in energy markets the geopolitical landscape was upended reshaping global trade and structural changes in labour markets became increasingly apparent driven by demographics technological transformation and evolving worker preferences given all these developments the fundamentals of our strategy have held up well as they should because a sound strategy must be robust to a changing environment our symmetric inflation target has proven effective in anchoring expectations even through some of the most severe and persistent shocks in recent economic history and our medium term orientation has provided essential fle ibility to absorb an e tremely large shock helping to reduce the overall cost of disinflation to the economy while still enabling a timely return of inflation to target we therefore saw no need to revisit these core pillars which is why we refer to the e ercise we have just concluded as a strategy assessment rather than a review the central theme of our work has been to update the framework so that monetary policy can continue to deliver price stability in the face of the new types of shocks we are confronting this evening without downplaying the other lessons learned i would like to highlight three key conclusions that have emerged from this work they concern the nature of the new environment how we assess the risks that arise from it and how we have adjusted our reaction function to safeguard price stability in this new world the changing environment one word has dominated the public debate in recent weeks uncertainty and this is one of the first key conclusions from our strategy assessment the world ahead is more uncertain and that uncertainty is likely to make inflation more volatile first we see clear signs that supply shocks are becoming more frequent model based analysis by ecb staff shows that during the recent inflation surge such shocks played a much greater role in driving inflation than they had over the previous two decades and even today supply side forces continue to generate inflation risks in both directions second we see mounting evidence that more regular supply disruptions are leading firms to adjust prices more frequently thereby contributing to greater inflation volatility this is not simply an e trapolation from the most recent shock rather it reflects a structural shift in how firms operate under conditions of permanently higher uncertainty research shows that in such an environment firms tend to react more quickly to shocks especially supply ones in order to protect against potential future losses at the same time they are more likely to adopt more fle ible pricing strategies which means prices may respond not just to major shocks but also to smaller frictions and local disruptions third if inflation becomes more volatile we could see non linearities on both sides in our last strategy review we rightly focused on the non linear dynamics that emerge in a prolonged environment of too low inflation where interest rates are eventually pushed to their effective lower bound that constraint can in turn feed into inflation expectations and risk creating a self fulfilling low inflation trap and we remain alert to the possibility of renewed downside inflation shocks but recent e perience has also revealed non linearities on the upside since firms are generally quicker to raise prices than to lower them more frequent price adjustments mean inflation can rise quickly in response to large upside shocks if wages then adjust only gradually to these price increases as we saw in recent years inflation may remain above target for longer as wage growth slowly catches up this in turn can raise the risk of inflation expectations de anchoring on the upside assessing the distribution of risks the next question that follows is if the economic environment becomes more volatile how can we make our economic assessment more robust large shocks can trigger feedback loops and non linear effects that inherently give rise to a broader range of possible outcomes in a world of higher uncertainty it is all the more important to augment the baseline with alternative risk scenarios this is why the second key conclusion of our assessment is the need for monetary policy to take into account risks and uncertainty using a systematic but conte t specific approach the ecb has used both scenario and sensitivity analysis for many years deploying internal scenarios since the global financial crisis and publishing them for the first time during the pandemic but our e perience in recent years has underscored the particular strength of scenario analysis in times of elevated uncertainty a clear e ample is russia s invasion of ukraine and the resulting energy price shock in that case scenarios provided insights that neither our baseline projections nor standard sensitivity analyses around the baseline could fully capture for instance in march just a few weeks after the invasion our baseline projected inflation at around for that year based on market implied energy futures the sensitivity analysis suggested a slightly higher figure of about in contrast the ukraine war scenario already pointed to inflation e ceeding close to the final annual figure of over at the same time there were moments when in hindsight publishing scenarios could have supported both our policymaking and our communication one e ample was the high uncertainty in about the speed of vaccine rollout and the nature of post pandemic reopening including the sectoral shifts in supply and demand across goods and services sectors both in the euro area and globally scenario analysis could have helped in illustrating that the range of possible inflation outcomes was unusually wide and reduced the risk of projecting false certainty to the public this is why our updated strategy commits to ensuring that our policy decisions account not only for the most likely path of inflation and the economy but also for the surrounding risks and uncertainty including through the appropriate use of scenario and sensitivity analyses the reaction function so what should our reaction function be if we know that the road ahead is likely to be more uncertain in our last strategy review we e plicitly acknowledged the risks posed by the effective lower bound our strategy statement called for especially forceful or persistent action when policy rates are close to the lower bound this asymmetric focus was grounded in the asymmetry of policy space and the downward inflation bias it can produce the lower bound continues to constrain monetary policy in the face of large disinflationary shocks but the recent inflation surge has revealed upside non linearities and with them the need for a two sided reaction function both in terms of forcefulness or persistence this is the third key conclusion of our strategy assessment this is not about reacting to small or temporary deviations but about a symmetric commitment to respond to inflation dynamics that could de anchor inflation expectations in either direction when disinflationary shocks risk pushing policy rates towards the lower bound acting forcefully early on helps minimise the time spent near that constraint likewise when inflation overshoots raise the risk of a feedback loop between frequent price adjustments and staggered wage responses forceful tightening at the outset is key to anchoring expectations we began our recent policy cycle with historically large rate hikes delivered at an unprecedented pace our analysis shows that had we not acted the probability of inflation expectations de anchoring would have e ceeded in and at the same time this policy cycle also offered new perspectives on optimal policy paths one insight from our last strategy review was that when rates are near the lower bound persistence can substitute for forcefulness helping to deliver the necessary policy stance with fewer side effects until recently however this concept had not been widely applied to tightening cycles typically forceful tightening follows an inverted v shape with rapid rate increases followed by relatively swift cuts but as rates move deeper into restrictive territory the costs and side effects of further tightening also grow at that point it can become optimal to shift the focus from forcefulness to persistence even if in principle there is no upper bound constraining policy space model simulations support this insight forcefulness and persistence can act as substitutes both capable of delivering the necessary disinflation but persistence in particular can help limit the economic and financial stability costs compared with continued rate increases this was borne out in our own e perience when we entered what i described as the holding phase we placed greater weight on the persistence dimension this allowed the disinflation process to advance at a steady pace while the so called sacrifice ratio remained historically low compared with previous disinflation episodes reflecting this e perience the governing council considers that its reaction function is best described as requiring appropriately forceful or persistent monetary policy action in response to large sustained deviations of inflation from the target in either direction to this end all our instruments remain available in our toolkit but the word appropriately is important as it underscores that the choice of instruments and the intensity with which we use them must reflect proportionality conclusion let me conclude our strategy assessment has been an e ercise in evolution not revolution and in fact many of its conclusions are already reflected in our current policy conduct we responded to the recent inflation shock with initially forceful and then persistent action aiming to steer inflation back to target as swiftly as necessary but as painlessly as possible and scenario analysis is helping us to better understand the range of risks ahead and how best to respond to them for e ample our scenarios on potential us import tariffs have helped us navigate an uncertain global trade landscape while also enabling us to communicate more clearly the two sided risks shaping our current monetary policy stance at our last monetary policy press conference in june i described our monetary policy stance as being in a good place following the conclusion of this strategy assessment i would add that our monetary policy strategy is also in a good place strengthened by e perience and better equipped for the challenges of the future to close the circle with nietzsche he who has a why to live can bear almost any how even as the

opening remarks press conference christine lagarde president of the ecb philip r lane member of the executive board of the ecb sintra june jump to the transcript of the questions and answers good afternoon ecb chief economist philip lane and i welcome you to this press conference on the occasion of the conclusion of the assessment of our monetary policy strategy the governing council recently agreed on an updated monetary policy strategy statement you can find this statement on our website together with an e planatory overview note and the two occasional papers presenting the underlying analyses i will start by putting this strategy assessment into the broader conte t philip lane will then go through the updated strategy statement and e plain what has changed and why as well as what has remained unchanged following the strategy review we carried out in the governing council committed to assess periodically the appropriateness of its monetary policy strategy with the next assessment e pected in such regular assessments ensure that our framework toolkit and approach remain fit for purpose in a changing world and the world has changed significantly over the last four years some of the issues we were most concerned about back in including inflation being too low for too long have taken a rather different turn not only did we see inflation surge but some fundamental structural features of our economy and the inflation environment are changing geopolitics digitalisation the increasing use of artificial intelligence demographics the threat to environmental sustainability and the evolution of the international financial system all of those suggest that the environment in which we operate will remain highly uncertain and potentially more volatile this will make it more challenging to conduct our monetary policy and fulfil our mandate to keep prices stable during the strategy assessment we asked what do these changes mean for the way we assess the economy conduct our policy use our toolkit take our decisions and communicate them in seeking to answer this question our mindset was forward looking on the whole we concluded that our monetary policy strategy remains well suited to addressing the challenges that lie ahead but our strategy also needs to be updated and adjusted in certain areas so that the ecb can remain fit for purpose in the years to come the next assessment is e pected in with our updated strategy statement we are taking a comprehensive perspective on the challenges facing our monetary policy so that the ecb can remain an anchor of stability in this more uncertain world this is our core message to the euro area citizens we serve the new environment gives many reasons to worry but one thing they do not need to worry about is our commitment to price stability the ecb is committed to its mandate and will keep itself and its tools updated to be able to respond to new challenges let me conclude by thanking on behalf of the governing council all the colleagues across the eurosystem who have contributed to this assessment in a great team effort i now hand over to our chief economist philip lane and following his remarks we will be ready to take your questions philip r lane i m going to focus on the paragraphs of the ecb s monetary policy strategy statement what s important is that behind these paragraphs is a lot of work the base layer is the two occasional papers i m sure you ve already read the pages in those two occasional papers there s a lot of rich new analysis of many dimensions in those two occasional papers then we have the overview note which the governing council worked on collectively and which basically provides the elaboration behind these paragraphs and i would say that in these paragraphs in this review we essentially tried to review the economic assessment where are we and where are we likely to be that was one of the two work streams that essentially primarily shows up in paragraph so paragraph you might say is one paragraph but it s a very important paragraph because it essentially outlines the challenges that we may face we had a similar paragraph last time but last time the focus was essentially on a lot of factors that can give rise to a low inflation world and a low interest rate world whereas the assessment this time of the eurosystem staff behind this is that when we look where we are now in the structural changes facing the world economy we have geopolitics and a lot of this is in the direction of rolling back globalisation last time we were looking at globalisation as a force which did contribute to low inflation before the pandemic there are many dimensions to geopolitics but we are of course already living it and this is something we do think is going to shape the next five years we already mentioned digitalisation the last time but this time we re calling that as a separate and important element artificial intelligence because of course i think for a long time it has been understood that the world economy automates and digitalises that s been around for a while that s mature what s not mature and where there s really a wide range of possibilities is what does it mean as the business sector and the public sector incorporate artificial intelligence i think we had already called out demography and the threat to environmental sustainability and i think we re very correct to have done so five years ago we ve seen a lot on these fronts in these five years let me remind you without immigration the european labour force would be shrinking so demography is not just a future trend it s a year by year reality for us and then this week last week this year last year all the time we see the impact of weather shocks and the impact of the green transition by the way investment in europe in recent years would have been a lot lower without the green transition it s the one solid driver of investment for many sectors at the moment we call out all of these elements but what s critical for our conclusion for monetary policy is that it creates uncertainty it creates volatility and we think what we may be faced with is larger deviations from our target in both directions so we have this two sided risk assessment and as i go through these paragraphs essentially once we ve identified this economic assessment the natural question to ask is how do we manage it how does monetary policy manage this two sided risk and essentially in what follows we will turn to the monetary policy implications but the other thing to note about paragraph is that there is a new sentence that s the final sentence it is that we don t live in a bubble we don t say monetary policy is the only game in town and we do highlight here that a more resilient financial architecture supported by progress on the savings and investments union the completion of banking union and the introduction of a digital euro would also support the effectiveness of monetary policy in this evolving environment so in other words all of these structural changes are much more easily handled if we have a more resilient euro european and euro denominated financial system and i think that s also important and maybe helps you to understand why we as board members and more generally the governing council spend a lot of time talking about these wider issues it s not a distraction from monetary policy it s an important underpinning for monetary policy paragraph is unchanged because paragraph is setting the legal conte t we have a mandate given by the treaty and so to make the strategy statement self contained it s a reminder to you of the legal and treaty constraints we live under and that essentially remains the same as last time the third paragraph because remember in the european treaty there s not a super detailed definition of price stability so it s important and this is something that evolved over the years that in terms of measurement we re focused on the harmonised inde of consumer prices hicp and again this is stable from last time last time we highlighted that we did think a reform of the hicp to include owner occupied housing would be desirable we continue to hold that view but in the end it s for the european statistical system to make progress on that so what we say is that in the meantime we do take into account inflation measures that include estimates of the cost of owner occupied housing so in other words we create supplementary indicators these are not official data but we do take a look and these would be relevant in scenarios where house prices were rising far more quickly or far more slowly than the overall inflation rate by the way this has not been particularly the issue in recent years it would not have made a big difference in recent years but of course in principle we could be in a situation in the future where it made a difference paragraph is again largely stable from last time it s e plaining why we target not zero and that s a fairly mature topic why you want to have a safety margin we do and i think correctly this time in the final sentence of paragraph include intersectoral adjustment in the last five years we ve seen this massive change between goods prices and services prices and actually it turns out that that s a very important consideration it s a lot easier to handle an under inflation target than if you re trying to hit zero essentially if you re trying to hit zero and the price of energy compared with goods rose implicitly you need to drive down the price of goods and we know for many reasons that deflation even at the sectoral level is difficult so having a target is reinforced by including intersectoral adjustment in that list so paragraph says you need a safety margin paragraph says is the best way to maintain price stability and that our commitment is symmetric so what this symmetry means is that we consider negative and positive deviations from the target as equally undesirable the last sentence i think has been critical in these years having a clear target you may have heard us all many times say it s not somewhere in the region of it s and having that clarity is very important for anchoring expectations so i think it turned out that that choice we made to be precise about what our orientation is in the medium term is very important let me turn to a paragraph where i think there has been an important change a sensible change something that you might say sounds so sensible why are you talking about it but it s worth highlighting the update last time in we felt we needed to point out that the symmetry of the target doesn t mean that how we set monetary policy looks identical whether we re above the target or below the target and so we pointed out that if we have a lower bound issue we need to be appropriately forceful or persistent what have we learnt from these five years that remains true for below target inflation but actually it s equally true for above target inflation and what we actually did was we had a phase of being forceful so from july to september we hiked a lot and then we went into a persistent phase so from september to june we had the overview note goes into more detail about why you need the blend of forceful and persistent but when we reviewed this peers said these were important concepts in relation to the lower bound but they re equally appropriate concepts in relation to being above target it s not of course in relation to blips what we talk about here is in response to large sustained deviations so you have to first of all make the call what we see in front of us is something that s materially away from and that would remain away from unless we responded and this is why we say appropriately forceful or persistent because what e actly is appropriate depends on whether you are dealing with an upside shock a downside shock and a wider set of issues so that i think is important let me come back to this issue that we have a symmetric commitment and we re two sided but the headache is different on both sides on the downside the lower bound is the main headache on the upside and this reflects so much of the last number of years and reflects a lot of the work in the occasional papers is possible non linearities in price and wage setting what we learnt is that once inflation starts to build it can take off and it can accelerate you can get this non linear dynamic and that s why you need to be forceful on the upside that s not really true for downside shocks they tend not to accelerate but downside shocks tend to get embedded because your ability to respond on monetary policy is different going back to this point that it s not about smoothing out every deviation from and it s large sustained deviations this is very much in the spirit of the medium term orientation and that s paragraph so paragraph is stable we already had a medium term orientation i think throughout the whole history of the ecb and i think that s been very wise our commitment in line with the opening remarks from the president is that people should be able to count on our commitment to price stability if we see a deviation we will bring it back to and that s our medium term orientation there s one enrichment here which i think makes sense people often ask how long is the medium term and i think a very important discipline on that is in the final sentence now subject to maintaining anchored inflation expectations that really defines the medium term as you know in recent years we mapped that into we will make sure inflation returns to target in a timely manner you need to impose some discipline on yourself as opposed to saying the medium term is always just over the projection horizon the medium term means not so long that the anchoring of expectations is put at risk so again i think that s always been true but it s better to be e plicit about it and maybe now as journalists if you ask governing council members in the future how long the medium term is the medium term is how long it takes without putting into question the anchoring of expectations paragraph is our toolbo paragraph we already said in that our primary instrument is the set of ecb policy rates i do wonder for those of you who were involved in looking at the ecb in how many of you fully believed that as we moved away from the lower bound we would stop quantitative easing qe and we would stop forward guidance but that was in our strategy and that s what we did these are tools that make sense at the lower bound they are not tools from a stance point of view that have the same role away from the lower bound so one basic message is already in we told you a lot about how the toolbo works but we did obviously come back and look at this it s an important topic let me highlight a couple of revisions here or amplifications one is that i think we are more articulate now about when these tools come into play one is to steer the monetary policy stance when the rates are close to the lower bound that s what we said last time that s definitely a big category but the second category is or to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission march is one e ample when the world s financial market was hit by the pandemic shock central banks in general did a lot of asset purchasing refinancing operations and other elements to stabilise the transmission of monetary policy so again what i would say is either it s because we re near the lower bound or there s some big drama causing an interruption to the transmission of monetary policy but otherwise these instruments remain in the toolbo they re available but they re not used on a continuous basis and so we list out these tools just as a reminder longer term refinancing and asset purchases those two would possibly be used either way for the stance or for smoothing the transmission of policy whereas of course negative rates and forward guidance are more particular to the lower bound so there is a differentiation within that category we also said last time that we will respond fle ibly to new challenges as they arise and we can consider new instruments and of course we told you that we considered new instruments and we actually did it because we did introduce the transmission protection instrument in and then the last sentence is important because this is where a lot of the discussion in the last year has been it is to look back at these this set of instruments and on a forward basis say in the future if we ever came to these situations how would we use these instruments so we say in this important sentence the choice of which one we use or which combination we use the design because on day zero we usually have a press release or a legal act saying here s the design of our instrument and the implementation so in other words month by month how we adjust it and how we bring it to an end in terms of e it all of these number one will enable an agile response to new shocks so let s not get locked into rigid programmes that would inhibit our ability to respond to new shocks they will reflect the intended purpose so there can be differences between a stance orientated intervention and a transmission smoothing type intervention and then of course all of these will be subject to a comprehensive proportionality assessment so in considering the choice of tools the design and the implementation we need the checklist of whether this is proportional to the challenge we face so that s as i say the toolbo then paragraph is e plaining how we make decisions a lot of this is similar to last time last time we basically had to tell you that we ve decided rather than having a two pillar strategy where we have an economic pillar and a monetary pillar we make an integrated assessment and in that integrated assessment for e ample we take into account macro financial linkages financial stability and so on so a lot of that remains but maybe you might find this new sentence interesting the second sentence is that in how we make decisions we take into account not only the most likely path for inflation in the economy i e in a projection for the baseline we don t just look at the baseline but also the surrounding risks and uncertainty how do we do that including through the appropriate use of scenario and sensitivity analysis this is something we have done forever but it s probably true that it s not always visible in how we communicate and also internally of course the science of how you should do scenarios and the science of how you should make sure your decisions are robust is always evolving so we do want to make this clear and in fairness for you and for others watching us you can say i think i understand this decision in the conte t of the baseline but i have a natural question is it also robust to the risk assessment of the ecb and i think that will be a step forward in the conversation about monetary policy by the way this is already reflected importantly because as you may have noticed what we ve said in the last couple of years is that we make our decisions not only based on the inflation outlook but also in relation to underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission because those two dimensions capture a lot of risk underlying inflation captured a lot of risk when we were bringing inflation down from to the strength of monetary transmission captured a lot of risk as we moved interest rates first of all steeply upwards and then as we ve been reversing so the logic behind the three pronged reaction function that we ve been using reflects these principles paragraph reaffirms and i think everything we ve learnt from the last four years validates the assessment that in terms of price stability climate change has profound implications in terms of the structure of the economy the rise and fall of particular sectors the cycle including through the impact of weather shocks and also in terms of how the financial system is adjusting this is also a policy priority for the european union and a global challenge so we are committed to ensuring the eurosystem fully takes into account in line with the eu s goals and objectives the implications of climate change and nature degradation for monetary policy and central banking we added because we ve already added it elsewhere and nature degradation because essentially it s the same headache and in terms of our economic analysis you ve also seen it in our publications the same underlying failure to incorporate the global public good of a sustainable environment permeates that paragraph reaffirms that clear communication is centre stage of our policymaking we want effective communication at all levels and this is why we think the layered and visualised approach to monetary policy communication is essential also we want to adapt in this rapidly changing communication landscape there s more on that in the overview note and as you know the ecb has been rolling out new types of communication including espresso economics on youtube in recent times and then maybe in line with the idea that it s good housekeeping to have a regular calendar based commitment the next assessment of the appropriateness of the strategy will be in my first question is for president lagarde tell us about the learning points what would you do differently if you could go back the second is for mr lane would you say that the bar for qe will be higher in the future than it was in the past i mean about launching it and about keeping it running knowing what you know now christine lagarde what have we learnt and what do we do differently going forward because i remind you that the strategy e ercise that we ve conducted is really to take stock understand appreciate the shortfalls and the upside of what we had planned and then looking forward see what needs to be improved and i would say that given the e ercise that was conducted in which was thorough deep drew on all the competences around the whole eurosystem and produced i think occasional papers from workstreams if you remember now you only have two occasional papers so given that the depth and the very broad ranging that was conducted in there is a lot that is still completely valid today as philip has e plained some of the paragraphs in what i call the commandments are still perfectly valid but i would say that the e ercise that we conducted in although we had the symmetric target in the medium term and we had a lot of the tools that have been identified not quite all was probably more influenced by the past that we had gone through and as a result if you look at the conclusions there s an element of elb effective lower bound about the strategy e ercise of given that we went through that rollercoaster sequence of very low inflation rate very high inflation rate and have now managed to bring inflation under control back to our target i think the virtue of the strategy is that it s a strategy for all circumstances it is well informed by the e ercise if ever there is another elb moment and an effective lower bound where the number of instruments we can use is limited and needs to be far fetched in a way but we are also well equipped for what we have seen which is much higher inflation and that led to i think one of the key changes that philip lane has identified which is this two sided reaction function in order to avoid what is undesirable downside and what is undesirable upside so that brings me to say we are equipped for all circumstances philip r lane i think the toolbo paragraph as you might imagine both last time and this time was carefully considered and i think it s also important to remember with qe and this is why we re more e plicit this time there are two very different scenarios one is monetary policy stance we re getting close to the lower bound and if we assess that there is a sustained material deviation from we have a list so we list out at that point and say what s in the choice set we could look at asset purchases we could look at long term refinancing operations we could look at rate forward guidance we could look at negative interest rates so here s our menu and let us go through the list of pros and cons in terms of effectiveness agility side effects i m not going to get into one liner type summaries because of course it s decisive in what e act conte t are you talking about they re unconventional for a reason they re all inferior to using the policy rate for the stance so that s one scenario you re running out of room on the rate and then you have to turn i would say by the way compared with five years ago we do say in the overview note that probably the equilibrium real rate has nudged up a bit not super high so in other words the probability of hitting the lower bound is probably lower than it was five years ago so it remains a concern but it s not necessarily at the level we had five years ago in any event that s one set of issues no easy choices but any future edition of the governing council has to go through that the strategy will say here s your list here s how you make decisions about using them agility side effects effectiveness and so on in the overview note it also says quite often a combination is more effective so rather than overloading any one instrument using a package of instruments can be more effective the other element is for market smoothing transmission sometimes you do need to go in and replace if the private sector is e iting but that can look very different and how we design a pure market smoothing type intervention would look quite different than a kind of a stance type intervention and then with the commitment to making sure any new programme is agile i m sure any future time we do qe no matter whether it s for stance or for smoothing or for some combination remember the pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp was a combination of both the way we write it in terms of the programme in terms of making sure it s agile that will definitely look different because last time we keyed the end of some of these programmes to shortly before we raised rates but i m sure we re going to have a more e pansive way of thinking about when we stop including this basic idea of scenario analysis that in other words it s not just about under the baseline but also in line with the evolving risk assessment it would e pand the way we think about the future not just going into qe but coming out of qe i m sure it will look different i have a question on a side phrase you actually said in the first part of the statement that changes in the international financial system will have effects on how to actually forecast inflation as well what do you have in mind when you say that which changes are there and also i would love to hear from you what you think will be the effects from ai usages across the whole spectrum will it rather be disinflationary or will it push prices up what is your early gauge philip r lane what i would say is we did write the financial system last time and honestly what we would have had in mind is for e ample the shift between banks and non banks we ve generalised it to the international financial system because first of all even that banks versus non banks there s a big global component because of course typically the non banking world has many currencies in their portfolios so that s one element i mean honestly from my point of view it also includes what we ve seen this year this year we ve seen the euro appreciate and that s clearly reflecting a shift in global investor preferences so that s a very basic e ample we also put in later in that paragraph that a more resilient european financial architecture would help to support monetary policy so again i think the world would look different with savings and investments union banking union and i m not saying from the point of view of monetary policy transmission but in terms of protecting the monetary autonomy of the euro area the digital euro i think is important for that christine lagarde i totally agree with what philip just said i would add that we just have to be alert to changes that are taking place and will be taking place in the financial sector and i think that the emergence of new payment mechanisms and here i m thinking about some of the most recent developments in stablecoins for instance will have an impact on the financial sector as well and to the e tent that our monetary transmission is relying heavily on the financial sector we have to be very attentive to how that is going to restructure the existing channels of transmission that we are used to it might very well and we have to be attentive to that on artificial intelligence we could spend the next day discussing that two things one is i think we are more and more all of us central banks around the world but certainly at the ecb using artificial intelligence in multiple dimensions and for multiple applications and i think the principle that we try to apply for that is being e tremely cautious and attentive in how it is used and how it is validated and what data it relies upon so not blindly following artificial intelligence produced models or results from them but checking and verifying so trust but verify as famously quoted by ronald reagan is certainly one that that would apply to our own use of artificial intelligence as far as the economy is concerned it is going to be transformational how heavy it will be in terms of investment how it will disseminate how the business models will form and what impact it will have on labour what productivity gains there will be i think is highly speculative and you will find opinions in the literature at the right and the left end of that range and if you remember last year in sintra actually we had some really interesting and insightful views about how transformational it would be and what impact it would have i d like to know how the updated strategy will influence the upcoming rate decisions for e ample will there be even more focus on the medium term versus the dip below the target in so maybe reducing the need for another cut and second on the implication of the international role of the euro you have been very vocal on that recently how would a bigger role for the euro influence the monetary policy of the ecb or its strategy there are discussions about structural overvaluation of the currency there are discussions about lower borrowing costs for governments and companies what is your assessment on that point christine lagarde on your first question i ll let philip take you backstage so that you appreciate how the work is done how the analysis is conducted on the basis of these proposed changes that have been approved unanimously by the way by the governing council in terms of what tools we have how they inform each other how much weight we give to risk and the role of scenario analysis so philip will take you backstage so you understand how decisions are thought through but on the international role of the euro i would like to refer you to a speech that i gave in berlin about two weeks ago in which i identified and articulated very clearly the three key components which any international currency should have if it wants to be one of the reserve currencies and that spans from a geopolitical role an economic role and legal certainty and i think on the three accounts as i said in that particular speech we are well positioned but we have work to do and i know that typically the cynical view is well maybe but why well maybe we shall see but one thing that i know we shall do as a central bank is deliver on the mandate that we have provide the beacon of certainty in a world that is vastly uncertain we will deliver on our mandate we will commit to that price stability and when people in the economic sphere ponder what is solid what is not solid we want them to appreciate that what we do is solid and the outcome of our work is robust the rest is going to belong to other decision makers and other policymakers but i think that there is a path and that path will impact us as well if we move forward in terms of banking union even further than crisis management and deposit insurance which is now agreed among the european member states if we move further than small steps on capital markets union if the concepts that abound at the moment in terms of safe european assets prosper then we shall see each other next year and some progress will have been made on that route to a broader international role of the euro philip r lane first of all i ll say both between the statement and now that gives you already a lot more conte t for how we make decisions before that you have to go back to i think to the last review and remember i joined the governing council in as governor of the central bank of ireland so i remember the ancient history as well and what i would say is honestly outside the ecb people were trying to invert or reverse engineer how we make decisions for e ample they might say your decision s driven by the point estimate at the last year in the forecast that was a popular way you just need to look at one number and that drives the decision but never has that been a good guide because it s always the case that central banks take into account risk and uncertainty so it s very important to look at how we go from here into and into in december we ll be looking at but no matter what the projection horizon is we re always going to be keeping an eye out because some of these dynamics will also play out longer and so what we re going to be doing and this is why we are very data dependent meeting by meeting number one is some of the big drivers of the forecast like how we ve seen a lot of volatility in energy markets recently we have the e change rate so there are going to be updates on that meeting by meeting but then one of the big issues in the economic occasional paper is this issue about how shocks get transmitted across the economy and the reality is there s going to be a long period now which i think was also in the bank for international settlements conversations this weekend when the old assumptions that essentially a lot of firms would just absorb cost increases without responding which was true for a long time but then in the pandemic they responded by raising prices so the issue now is we have had a big movement in energy prices a significant movement in the e change rate among other factors what we do not know now but we will be learning month by month is is this widening across the economy are we seeing the service sectors that use a lot of energy adjust their pricing and so on so nothing is precooked a lot is going to turn on how these shocks to the economy permeate you will have heard many people comment over the years that it s always at the end of the projection horizon but that s a common feature of central banking another big influence is basically our monetary policy so the reason why we have in a big reason is that people believe us people believe that we will do what s needed to bring inflation back to in the medium term and so when we make a forecast it s embedded that monetary policy will respond appropriately to the shocks so in other words i d imagine most of the time you will see in the medium term that doesn t mean it falls from heaven it means monetary policy will adjust and that any short term deviation will not be permitted to be sustained so what i would say is the question is what do we need to do and what we need to do will depend on the incoming data our assessment is this is a sustained deviation from our target if we didn t respond would it get embedded there s a big checklist and what i would say is that we would like to try and give you as much as we can in terms of information in the projections on top of what we say as the governing council there is a projections article afterwards there are many blogs working papers and so on but we also don t publish plenty of material because it needs to remain confidential in a good preparation for the meeting at a confidential level we go through many what if scenarios we do many sensitivity analyses the staff publish in the projections article what happens if the e change rate is at the th or th percentile what happens if energy prices move but we do far more than that this remains ongoing work and so it sounds super simple as long as inflation is at in the medium term but behind that is what do we need to do to maintain that to protect that anchor given the international conte t since the last review covid wars trade how does the ecb respond to critics who say that it should significantly change the toolbo instead of trying to keep it the same christine lagarde we take critics and criticism and we are actually quite used to it but we pay attention because obviously it identifies where the perception by others than those backstage making the decision is and if there is a perception that there is a shortfall that there is something that hasn t worked then we look at it and we take that into account so during the various crises and the major shocks that were in a way successive but also compounded we responded and i think we demonstrated great agility in responding to those shocks and to this line of shocks for e ample we came up with a new instrument that simply didn t e ist at the time the transmission protection instrument that we came up with in july it didn t e ist it wasn t in the toolbo the other instruments that we worked on weren t needed eventually but that s what we do because we re guided by the mandate that we have been given the target that we have decided and we fle ibly and with agility respond to new situations but the beauty of the e ercise that we ve conducted i think is to take stock and keep what was to be kept from but also look at what we learnt from the last four years and improve the instruments that needed to be improved in order to refine the projections arrive at better proposals and have even more robust recommendations i think the e ample that philip just gave where of course the baseline is decisive and of course we have regularly conducted scenario analysis and of course we have conducted sensitivity analysis but i think that the change that philip has identified is that it s not going to be the scenario analysis with a few e ogenous causes as we have done in the last four big published scenario analyses we re going to go deeper than that and anticipate the transformation that will affect the economy going forward and we will test what we are proposing against those scenarios and inform the baseline that still remains decisive with those scenario analyses i hope i ve addressed your question could you give us a little bit more colour on how to really make sense of this increased focus on the fact that you will also fight inflation forcefully and persistently when it goes up but at the same time you stress philip that you will only do so if it s not a blip but a persistent and permanent trend if we travel back in time to and i think the problem back then wasn t that the ecb said we won t fight inflation if it s going up persistently but for quite a long time it was thought that it s not a persistent thing so if the current approach had applied back then would it have been different or not as a learning e ercise more than as an implicit criticism and my second question is on the toolbo you stress that the unconventional tools are still part of the toolbo and then you give some e amples of what those instruments are but it s clearly not a closed list so are there any tools that are off limits and if so which are they was this discussed in the strategy review or is basically everything possible if you think it s necessary christine lagarde i just want to remind you that we believe collectively as a governing council that any significant or material deviation from our inflation target on the way up and on the way down full symmetry you only talked about inflation on the way up so it s full symmetry and the response is of course going to be conte t specific and is going to be a two sided response to avoid the material deviation that we do not want it s undesirable at both ends philip r lane if you take a longer history of the ecb it s probably fair to say as inflation fell below ten years ago the ecb did take some time to say whether it was a material sustained deviation or whether it will self correct the issue about making the call that this is something that warrants a monetary policy reaction this is why i don t think we re going to be replaced quite yet by the ai it s going to require a lot of work a lot of judgement in both directions and fundamentally i think we definitely had a baseline in and even in early that essentially there would be a reversion back to target fairly quickly and therefore there was not a big monetary policy call so then the question is the risk assessment at the time and i went back to the s and s and there were papers about non linear adjustment but there was for a while maybe not so much evidence that the non linear adjustment was taking over but then by summer it was very much in our face so now we know that the whole pandemic is going to leave a legacy because we have a concrete e ample now where actually the non linearity has moved from being theory to being actually visible and there s a plausibility now that people are more used to raising prices there s a plausibility that maybe that can kick in even in different circumstances in the future so what i would say is we didn t spend our time going back and doing a genuine kind of full scale put ourselves back in that position and see because i think that s impossible to do what s important is to learn from the episode what i would say is with this new strategy we are if you like pre committing here that whatever we decide to do is based not just on the baseline but also on the risk assessment so you collectively will be asking us your decision looks ok under the baseline e plain to me how it s also robust as far as it can be robust under the risk assessment so i think that is the difference because that was maybe not the way the conversation was at that time and maybe just to join the president again this issue is working out what i would say is what we already heard the last time the scale of the monetary policy response depends on the scale of the problem sometimes you need to campaign with a campaign then going from to over a year that was a big campaign we ve had a big campaign since then where we are now is we ve come back to target and we ve brought rates down a lot so sometimes you have a campaign and sometimes you re in cyclical management you re nudging in response to smaller scale risk assessments so hopefully we re in a calmer world but we re not signing up to any assessment of where we re going and let me come back to this issue because the temptation is to say is ai going to be net inflationary that s not the way to think about any of these the way to think about it is it creates uncertainty we do think it creates volatility and honestly with most of these i can see scenarios where in one time period it s downside in another scenario it s upside so all of this is basically stuff we have to integrate but it s not leading us to a universal net message with ai right now there s a lot of investment in data centres and so on we re in an investment phase at a different phase we could be in a productivity enhancing phase where they really are lowering costs in the economy and the e act time periods where either the demand side or the supply side dominates that s going to be the subject we re going to have to watch for in the coming years you talked about the world becoming more unpredictable possibly more volatile why not review the strategy more frequently why not have even more reviews rather than waiting till because of some of the trade offs there and then to bring us back to climate the language there still seemed quite forceful around the importance of climate change and thinking about these objectives were there any reflections on the limitations of what the central bank can do in terms of also its own distribution of resources towards this issue in a more volatile world christine lagarde you actually addressed with your second question the response i was going to give you on the first because if you re proposing to the team which is sitting in the back of the room that we should do the strategy assessment every year i think they re going to have a fit because this is a massive e ercise each workstream had the coordination of about experts economists of all stripes from around the eurosystem under the leadership of both christophe and christiane who each had to harness the competence the egos and come to some sensible conclusions that were then debated and put to the governing council for further iteration and eventually unanimous support so it s a massive e ercise second the way in which it has been orchestrated and calibrated now i think gives us what i call a strategy for all circumstances or a strategy for all seasons whether we get way too high or way too low the toolbo is there the assessment that we will do is technically soundly based as has been described and we have our focus on stability as we have defined delivering target inflation as we have defined it with the same unequal tolerance for material deviation respectively from the downside or from the upside with conte t specific responses that we are characterising as two sided responses on climate the inclusion of climate in was a bit of a breakthrough because not everyone was convinced this particular time there was a lot less debate as to the relevance of climate change as a component in our assessment of the economic situation of the risk of inflation of the price impact and of the risk management that we are accountable to european citizens when it comes to the validity of our monetary portfolio but also of all the portfolios for non monetary purposes as well as you will have noted we ve added one word which is nature degradation which did not feature in the strategy and that is just to follow suit from what has been clearly flagged by the european commission as another component of the same disaster that we re facing,ECB-RSS,Speech,True,English,0

minister kilepa executive director ms duarte distinguished members of the green climate fund board development partners and dear friends good evening to you all it has been our pleasure to welcome you to our nation s capital port moresby on behalf of the bank of papua new guinea and all who have been involved this week thank you for being here and for bringing your commitment your questions your e pertise and above all your shared purpose we never take for granted what it means for papua new guinea to host a gathering like this it matters deeply to us that voices from small island nations can be heard not just in technical sessions or in written submissions but with a seat at the table in our own region and with our own perspectives guiding the conversation in png climate change is not a distant concept it is lived daily along our coastlines in our flood prone valleys and among our communities working to protect the forests that store carbon for the world when the board of the green climate fund makes room for countries like ours to contribute as thought partners it sends a powerful message to us that you know and you understand the path we are travelling on we are sincerely grateful for the gcf s funding of million dollars to assist with png s efforts to manage our forests more sustainably this support will have a real impact not just for the environment but for the livelihoods and wellbeing of the many people involved in sustainable forest management activities in papua new guinea it is an important contribution to global climate mitigation efforts and we commend the gcf for its unwavering leadership in driving global efforts toward climate resilient development the deliberations this week have also reinforced the essential role institutions like the gcf play in ensuring that countries such as ours can access the support and resources necessary to tackle the climate crisis as a central bank the bank of png never imagined we would one day be leading green finance programs but as we ve listened and learned especially from other countries in our region we ve come to understand that if climate resilience is to be real it must run through our entire economic system it must embrace the way we manage risk regulate banks and think about growth we now recognize both the systemic risks of climate change and the powerful role that finance can play in mitigating them for small island developing states sids resilience is not merely aspirational it is e istential and central banks must take an active role in enabling the transition to low emission climate resilient economies while safeguarding financial system stability strategic alliances with development partners are essential and i would also like to acknowledge the invaluable support and strategic partnerships of some other key development allies including the australian and new zealand governments the french development bank the international finance corporation the alliance for financial inclusion and the global green growth institute with the help of our development partners we have made some remarkable progress in laying the foundation for a sustainable finance ecosystem we launched our national green ta onomy introduced our inclusive green finance policy and established the green finance centre under the bank of papua new guinea to lead and coordinate our efforts earlier this year we hosted our inaugural green finance summit bringing international agencies private investors and domestic financial institutions together to align on a national climate finance roadmap these collaborations have helped us take practical steps small at first but building momentum the momentum has been e traordinary and it continues to grow under our sustainable finance roadmap we are advancing two flagship green financial instruments the green refinancing facility and the green guarantee facility scheduled to go live by august these facilities will help de risk and unlock climate aligned lending across the banking sector we are also developing thematic bond guidance with the aim of png s first green bond issuance in a significant step towards diversifying our financing tools papua new guinea s green finance roadmap is strongly aligned with the gcf s strategic priorities particularly in unlocking private capital building institutional capacity and supporting the market for green finance instruments in countries vulnerable to climate change none of these initiatives is about making a grand announcement it is about moving steadily and with purpose towards systems that serve both the people and the planet it has also meant asking ourselves hard questions about equity about access and about how to create conditions where private capital can work for public good without losing sight of the needs of the most vulnerable we know we re still learning but we hope our e perience might offer something useful to others just as we ve drawn so much from the e amples and encouragement of fellow sids small island developing states and developing nations who are walking similar paths to the gcf board thank you for spending this time with us for listening for challenging and for believing that it is possible to shift the centre of gravity in climate finance to places like the pacific where the stakes are high but the commitment to our combined global efforts to tackling climate change runs deep please enjoy the rest of your stay in port moresby and safe travels as you return home tenkiu tru about the

today marks another transformative milestone as we operationalize one of the roadmap s most critical pillars content development and harmonization this strategic focus addresses a fundamental challenge that has long hindered our collective progress while numerous institutions including the central bank have maintained active roles in promoting financial literacy e perience has demonstrated that fragmented approaches and sporadic interventions are insufficient to catalyze the profound sustainable behavioral changes our society requires previous surveys revealed that while many sri lankans possess adequate financial knowledge significant behavioral gaps persist evidenced by concerning patterns of over indebtedness inadequate budgeting practices insufficient savings culture and susceptibility to financial fraud this reality underscores a crucial truth knowledge alone is insufficient we must cultivate appropriate skills and attitudes that empower sri lankans to make prudent informed and rational financial decisions today s initiatives directly address these challenges with unprecedented scope and precision sri lanka s first comprehensive financial literacy curriculum i

borrowing saving and investing they become less susceptible to financial distress over indebtedness or e ploitation by unauthorized entities this enhanced financial resilience reduces systemic risks and strengthens the stability of our financial institutions furthermore when citizens understand economic variables such as inflation interest rates and currency movements the transmission of monetary policy becomes more effective aligning public behavior with national economic objectives financial literacy also strengthens public confidence in financial institutions informed consumers are more likely to engage with the formal financial sector and hold financial service providers accountable for ethical and responsible conduct in this manner financial literacy supports both market discipline

morning everyone many thanks to the organisers for inviting me here today it s a pleasure to be part of this distinguished panel heraclitus the greek philosopher famously asserted everything changes and nothing stays this observation is valid across all aspects of life and central banking is no e ception it was not that long ago when monetary policy was thought to be a policy instrument with limited influence even by central bankers one notable central banker who held that view was arthur burns who was federal reserve chairman in the s and so when inflation started rising in the united states following the first oil price shock in the early s burns kept his foot on the monetary policy gas pedal u s president ni on was facing re election and burns did not want to jeopardize ni on s chances by allowing unemployment to rise burns advocated wage price controls and not monetary policy as the best way to prevent inflation what followed was the great inflation a combination of double digit inflation and double digit unemployment rates not all central banks acted that way both the bundesbank and the swiss national bank to name two notable e ceptions tightened monetary policy in response to the s oil price shocks as a result their economies escaped from the oil price shocks in much better condition both in terms of inflation and in terms of unemployment than that of the united states that e perience taught central banks a lesson monetary policy needs to focus on inflation if it wants to prevent stagflation that is a combination of high inflation and high unemployment today no central banker would doubt that firm resolve is needed to tame inflation even if as in the period following the covid shock inflation was mainly supply driven consequently the evolution of thinking about what central banks can and cannot do has been profound during the past years i the evolving central bank mandate related to that another significant change has been the adoption of price stability as the primary objective of central banks reflecting the hard learned lessons of the great inflation era in the s to which i just referred and many central banks have been granted political independence those two developments are intrinsically connected because e perience has shown that a politically independent central bank is best positioned to deliver price stability to its citizens the european central bank ecb is a prime e ample of a central bank that is both independent and legally bound to achieve price stability but the journey didn t end there fast forward to the global financial crisis gfc that profound shock revealed structural vulnerabilities in the financial system in response many central banks broadened their mandates to include e plicit financial stability objectives central banks were granted sole or co responsibility for macroprudential tasks effectively tools to prevent systemic risk in the euro area this translated into a monumental institutional development the creation of the banking union entrusting the direct supervision of significant banks to the ecb in close cooperation with national authorities this marked a pivotal step in strengthening financial stability an important precondition for price stability more recently the post pandemic inflation surge and other structural shifts reignited the debate around inflation targets and policy frameworks the following question was addressed are our current objectives instruments and operational frameworks truly fit for purpose in this highly uncertain and volatile world should we revise our mandate by integrating other considerations without compromising the primary objective of price stability ii the ecb s monetary policy strategy a stability anchor my focus today will be on the eurosystem our price stability mandate is enshrined in the treaty on the functioning of the eu why is this so vital because history has shown us the deep and lasting damage that can be caused by deviations from price stability how we deliver on our mandate is defined by our monetary policy strategy central to this strategy is our unambiguous and symmetric inflation target over the medium term the point target was made e plicit in it replaced a more comple formulation providing greater clarity it offered a stable reference point that is easy for the public to understand enhancing wage and price setting thereby strengthening the anchoring of inflation expectations since its creation in and until the shocks of the early s the ecb delivered inflation close to on average this helped build credibility a precious asset thanks to this credibility even during the recent inflation surge long term expectations remained well anchored that in turn allowed us to act forcefully to bring inflation back to target while also achieving a soft landing of the economy you might ask why and not zero the answer lies in fle ibility an inflation buffer above zero provides monetary policy with space for interest rate cuts in the event of adverse developments and with a safety margin against the risk of deflation it also addresses issues like downward nominal rigidities and measurement bias several academics and policymakers have called for raising the target above such proposals have to be carefully weighed against potential risks to central bank credibility frequent adjustments to the target risk undermining the credibility we have worked so hard to build if markets e pect the target to keep shifting inflation expectations could de anchor making our job much harder our focus on the medium term is equally important as it gives us valuable fle ibility monetary policy acts with long and variable lags a medium term approach enables us to navigate inflationary or deflationary pressures in a stepwise gradual manner without overreacting in ways that might harm economic activity and employment this approach allows us to look through short lived supply driven deviations of inflation from target which are e pected to dissipate over time an important strand of the literature e plores monetary policy implications from heterogenous developments in prices across sectors such approaches underscore the critical importance of delving into granular data to help the understanding of how prices are changing in the economy at the ecb inflation analysis includes a broad range of measures encompassing headline and various metrics of underlying inflation to help us assess the dynamics and drivers of inflation our aim is to ensure that our policies are transmitted smoothly and effectively across member states and segments of the economy in order to enhance the prosperity of our citizens this is key in a monetary union where financial structures and economic conditions still differ widely i rethinking mandates responding to emerging challenges let me now turn to broader challenges that call for a forward looking reassessment of central bank roles central banks do not operate in a vacuum in the euro area we must navigate a particularly comple environment this environment is shaped by fragmented capital markets persistent geopolitical tensions that impact energy markets and supply chains the urgency of climate risks and a pressing need to address the productivity gap vis à vis other major economic areas let me be clear central banks are not the main actors in resolving these challenges that responsibility lies primarily with governments and legislators in europe however monetary policy has a vital supporting role to provide an anchor of stability by safeguarding our primary objective maintaining low and predictable inflation we secure a fundamental condition for sustainable growth this in turn fosters confidence among households and firms spurring investment and job creation over the past year as inflation has eased we have been able to largely remove policy restrictiveness this easing in financing conditions will make capital more affordable and accessible which is essential for investment in a time of very high uncertainty the ecb has also been a frontrunner in contributing to some of these broader agendas within our mandate we are actively integrating climate related considerations into our operations risk assessments and supervisory and collateral frameworks in our strategy assessment climate remains a policy priority within our remit yet there is something that cannot change monetary policy cannot drive europe s transformation alone that s why we are pressing for progress in other areas notably financial architecture such progress can support the effectiveness of our monetary policy a point made clear also in our strategy assessment to mobilize investment at the scale needed to re invigorate growth and ensure that the benefits flow seamlessly across borders we need to finalise the banking union and deepen the capital markets union a fully fledged savings and investments union is essential it will fundamentally improve how our financial system channels savings into productive investment especially in critical areas like energy defence and innovation all pressing priorities for our union a more integrated union will allow the euro to take on a greater role as an international currency this means not only sharing in the benefits that come with that global status but also stepping up to the responsibility that comes with it especially at a time when the world is increasingly marked by uncertainty and division europe must rise to the occasion the ecb is working towards the digital euro a project that can strengthen the international role of our currency in the digital era this initiative can increase efficiency innovation and resilience while protecting our monetary sovereignty the current institutional setup poses an important obstacle because the ecb essentially operates without a genuine fiscal counterpart at the euro area level a permanent central fiscal capacity a shared framework for managing public finances would be a true turning point enabling coordinated investment and shared responsibility for growth enhancing initiatives the recovery and resilience facility rrf could serve as a valuable blueprint for the future the creation of a common european safe asset can be a key instrument for deepening financial integration and resilience across the euro area this along with the elimination of internal barriers which fragment the european market as described in the letta report and in various imf studies and are in fact equivalent to internal high tariffs will increase the rate of return on domestic investment leading to a higher investment ratio as suggested by the draghi report thus closing the investment and productivity gap with the us more ambitious proposals such as the one recently put forward by olivier blanchard and ángel ubide deserve consideration they could help create a deep and liquid eu bond market that could achieve greater global significance v the fiscal and monetary interactions let me elaborate more on the interplay between fiscal and monetary policy an enabling force to the achievement of price stability and financial stability is sound fiscal policy that supports monetary policy in the euro area we learnt the hard way during the debt crisis that fiscal and monetary policies should be aligned reinforcing each other this could lead to more effective crisis resolution and stronger economic recovery as e emplified in the handling of the pandemic the optimal outcome arises when both policies are aligned but critically with a clear understanding of their respective roles responsibilities and mandates today as political pressure builds in some jurisdictions to cut interest rates coordination without subordination is paramount it is critically important to maintain the central bank independence and ensure that policymakers can uphold their primary mandate of price stability conclusion to conclude in a world of constant flu central bank mandates are not written in stone they are continuously evolving in response to significant challenges and shifting economic landscapes yet the foundation must remain firm a firm credible clear commitment to price stability this is our best contribution to economic growth job creation and the welfare of our citizens a more efficient architecture of the euro

gent sejko bolstering credit to the agriculture sector address by mr gent sejko governor of the bank of albania at the roundtable on bolstering credit to the agriculture sector organised by the bank of albania and the ministry of finance tirana july the views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the bis central bank speech july by gent sejko pdf full te t kb pages dear minister minister of finance dear representatives of the banking sector let me start by conveying my heartfelt thanks for your participation in this important roundtable discussion co organized with the ministry of finance this event aims to identify the appropriate pathways and instruments for opening a new chapter regarding credit to the agricultural sector in albania as we have emphasized in many previous discussions and communication platforms lending to the agricultural sector has been and continues to be a structural weakness for both our economy and banking sector the comparison of the significant role that agriculture plays in the albanian economy with the limited level of credit this sector receives from the banking sector clearly illustrates this weakness agriculture accounts for around of gdp of albania and employs around of population yet it benefits less than of total bank credit moreover recent trends in the agricultural lending have not been encouraging the underlying reasons of the low level of credit to the agricultural sector ranging from property ownership issues and high levels of informality to the relatively high business risk and low productivity due to the absence of economies of scale have been consistently discussed some of these problems still remain relevant while others are gradually being addressed however even in this challenging conte t credit to the agricultural remains low this deficiency must be addressed without further delay if we aim at boosting the stable development of this sector that is crucial for the albanian economy against this backdrop the bank of albania has aligned its financing programme to micro small and medium sized enterprises to emphasize the growth of credit to the agricultural sector this program that involves all stakeholders in the banking sector offers a reliable and sustainable source of low cost funding to support lending of development projects in the agricultural sector including agrotourism and the agro food industry last the government of albania has undertaken concrete steps in this regard by making available a sovereign guarantee scheme for loans granted to the agriculture sector this guarantee significantly mitigates the credit risk related with this sector in turn considerably reducing one of the fundamental problems we have discussed and the collateral we deem that both development projects provide a solid platform for progressing further as we make a new qualitative step in lending to the agriculture nevertheless the success of this platform considerably dependents on the involvement and the commitment to utilising its instruments in this conte t allow me to draw your attention to three important points first from the narrower perspective of the business interests you represent i would like to highlight that the low level of lending to the agricultural sector should be considered equally both as a reflection of existing structural and operational problems and as a potential indicator for the high returns you may have from investments in this sector in light of this i encourage you to give agricultural sector the attention and e pertise it rightly deserves second from the perspective of the overall economic development the growth of the agricultural sector aligned and progressing in parallel with other sectors of the economy should be regarded as a crucial pillar for the long term and sustainable development of albania from this standpoint as primary actors in albania s economic and financial landscape you are encouraged to view lending to the agricultural sector as a strategic investment that yields positive returns for the country s sustainable and inclusive growth third as key actors in the social life of the country the support to the agriculture sector should also be viewed as a moral obligation toward albania the country where you safely carry out your business and in a profitable manner supporting the food supply chain industry remains a factor of vital importance for a country and its population dear representatives of the banking sector i kindly invite you to consider the issues addressed above more as an appeal to your rational judgement than to your emotions the bank of albania will not under no circumstances take measures that would jeopardise the soundness of your financial positions or undermine the financial stability interests of albania in the long term that said while safeguarding financial stability i believe it is appropriate to engage in an open and transparent dialogue aimed at rethinking our approach to lending in the agricultural sector in line with the long term interests of the social and economic development of albania thank you about the author gent sejko more from

vasileios madouros opening statement oireachtas select committee on budgetary oversight opening statement by mr vasileios madouros deputy governor of the central bank of ireland at the oireachtas select committee on budgetary oversight dublin july the views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the bis central bank speech july by vasileios madouros pdf full te t kb pages good afternoon chair and members of the committee thank you for inviting us to appear before the committee today i am joined by my colleagues martin o brien head of our irish economic analysis division and thomas conefrey deputy head in the same division we very much welcome the opportunity to engage with you on the outlook for the economy and the public finances in my opening statement i will cover briefly our latest assessment of the economic outlook as outlined in our june quarterly bulletin as well as our latest economic advice to the government as outlined in the governor s pre budget letter pdf mb published last week the economic outlook let me start with the global conte t because the key factors shaping the domestic outlook stem from developments abroad but with important implications for ireland since the start of the year we have seen a material shift in trade policy with rising tariffs between the us and its trading partners as well as a sharp increase in policy uncertainty in light of these developments the global growth outlook has weakened short term forecasts for world trade and economic activity have been revised downwards and uncertainty around these forecasts is particularly elevated given the range of potential outcomes around trade policy the openness of the irish economy and the prominent role that fdi and multinational firms play domestically mean that ireland is particularly e posed to changes in the global economic outlook as well as shifts in trade policy and broader economic policy in the us given uncertainty over the future direction of us trade policy our june quarterly bulletin presented projections for the economy under a baseline and a more adverse scenario these were based on different assumptions around the level and coverage of tariffs the level and persistence of uncertainty and the future path of financing conditions in the baseline scenario we e pected modified domestic demand to grow by per cent in and by per cent per annum on average in and this is a downward revision to the growth outlook relative to our previous projections but the central outlook is still consistent with a full employment economy the adverse scenario assumed persistently higher and broader tariffs including due to retaliation from the eu it also assumed that policy uncertainty would remain higher for longer and that financing conditions would be tighter in this scenario annual average mdd growth would almost halve compared to the baseline illustrating the sensitivity of economic activity to an escalation of trade tensions the trade offs facing the public finances the economy and public finances are entering this period of heightened uncertainty from a strong position but there are also underlying vulnerabilities that need to be managed carefully the e ceptional growth in corporation ta receipts since and the strong pace of economic e pansion in recent years have resulted in a marked increase in government revenues as a result even with the substantial rise in government spending and some ta cuts the headline budget balance has run substantial surpluses in recent years however e ternal developments mean that this benign combination of factors namely a rapidly growing economy and e ceptional corporate ta receipts could be at risk in the coming years in particular risks to the fiscal position from lower corporate ta es and other mne dependent ta es have increased given recent international developments and e cluding estimated e cess corporation ta and the impact of the apple state aid case the budget balance has been in a persistent deficit position for consecutive years at the same time in the current juncture an important public policy priority is the need for higher investment both to address infrastructure deficits and to support the transition to net zero indeed these infrastructure deficits have become an increasingly significant factor constraining the supply side of the economy addressing infrastructure deficits will not only help meet important societal and economic needs today but also enable our economy to remain competitive amid a shifting geopolitical landscape finally looking further into the future there are known future funding needs that the state needs to prepare for today given demographic trends ireland is e pected to see the largest increase in age related spending on areas such as pensions healthcare and long term care amongst the eu by and we know already that the future ireland fund the establishment of which has been a very positive public policy intervention will not be sufficient on its own to finance the higher level of public e penditure that will be required to meet the needs of an older population overall the current environment presents important trade offs for fiscal policy between investing in infrastructure but not adding e cessively to demand in a capacity constrained economy between addressing the funding needs of today but also preparing for the funding needs of the future managing those trade offs while undoubtedly this presents a difficult balancing act careful management of the public finances can contribute to achieving these multiple aims so let me finish off by summarising our economic policy advice outlined in the governor s pre budget letter in light of those trade offs i will focus on three areas in particular first it is important that the government commits and adheres to a credible fiscal anchor that results in sustainable increases in net government e penditure over time in the current conte t of the economy operating at capacity it is important from a macro stabilisation perspective that the overall fiscal policy stance does not add e cessively to demand second within that overall fiscal envelope the public finances need to prioritise investment sustainably achieving the necessary rise in public investment requires creating sufficient economic and fiscal space through offsetting choices in terms of current spending or ta ation beyond demand management considerations broadening the ta base is also important for addressing future funding needs and mitigating the reliance of the public finances on corporate ta receipts third public investment alone will not be sufficient to address the economy s infrastructure gaps measures that reduce delays and therefore the ultimate costs in the planning and building of infrastructure are needed to help ensure that the benefits of public investment for long term growth are realised fully measures that incentivise scale and investment in new machinery equipment and technologies in the construction sector can also help enhance productivity and enable more sustainable delivery of housing and infrastructure these structural policies can have an outsized impact on strengthening the supply side of the economy complementing and adding to the effectiveness of additional public investment in infrastructure thank you for your attention and we look forward to your questions about the author vasileios madouros more from this author related information more speeches from central bank of

eddie yue unlocking value through china s resilience keynote speech by mr eddie yue chief executive of the hong kong monetary authority at the bond connect anniversary summit on unlocking value through china s resilience hong kong july the views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the bis central bank speech july by eddie yue pdf full te t kb pages ladies and gentlemen good morning it is an honour to join you today as we celebrate the th anniversary of the bond connect the theme today unlocking value through china s resilience could not be more timely the global capital markets are undergoing profound transformation driven by a host of factors including increasing trade tensions geopolitical and economic shifts and changing investment appetite and patterns these changes are reshaping the way capital flows across the world creating both new opportunities and challenges for market participants now let me first share some observations about the macro trends macro trends the first trend is global diversification global capital markets have been on a roller coaster driven by shifting policies and economic uncertainties in light of these unpredictable swings diversification stands out as the most essential investment strategy indeed we are now in a world of unprecedented choice and many more institutional investors are looking to further diversifying their portfolios the strong investor response to the hong kong government s recent issuance of hk billion in green and infrastructure bonds is telling of the diversifying trend this multi currency issuance attracted participation from a wide spectrum of investors from more than markets across asia europe middle east and the americas with total order at about times of the issuance size in particular the year hkd government bond was offered for the first time further e tending the hkd yield curve the year and year rmb government bonds which were first introduced last year also received overwhelming support doubling in issuance size from last year against this backdrop of global trend for diversification china s bond assets have emerged as a particularly compelling choice first china s bond market is the second largest in the world chinese bonds have the market depth and liquidity to become an increasingly important asset class among global investors secondly china has a relatively low debt level with the general government debt to gdp ratio at around which is much lower than some major advanced economies thirdly the low correlation between china s onshore market and major global markets at just over the past years makes china bonds a very good diversifier fourthly the risk adjusted return of china bonds is relatively attractive onshore rmb bonds had an annualised volatility of around over the past year significantly lower than the volatility in other advanced markets during the same period this combination of features of china s bond market as an attractive asset class for global investors seeking high quality investments in fact according to a recent survey on central banks over of the respondents e pect to increase their rmb holdings in the next five years the second trend is mainland china s rapid wealth accumulation particularly in institutional capital which is creating new opportunities for their outbound investment for e ample china s national pension reserve fund grew to around usd billion by the end of recent policy discussion also reaffirms that china encourages the national pension fund to cooperate with high quality overseas investment managers to optimise its investment approach the new private pension scheme has already attracted over million participants since its inception in with this rapidly growing pool of capital projected to reach nearly usd trillion by as mainland institutional investors increasingly seek to diversify their portfolios and e pand overseas asset allocation there is significant potential for future growth in the southbound bond connect through hong kong s platform to invest overseas these two way trends global investors growing interest in rmb denominated bonds and mainland investors e panding overseas allocations underscore the critical role of the bond connect as a gateway to facilitate cross border capital flows between the mainland and global financial markets in a rapidly changing global financial landscape the ability to adapt and innovate is key bond connect e emplifies the power of collaboration and innovation in addressing the changing needs of investors as it continues to evolve over the years policy work in the past year we have been working closely with relevant mainland authorities especially with the people s bank of china to step up efforts to enhance the bond connect and its ecosystem i wish to take the opportunity to make the following three announcements first under the northbound channel investors can already use bond connect bonds as collateral for the hong kong monetary authority hkma s rmb liquidity facility margin collateral for otc clearing hong kong limited otcc derivative transactions and for conducting offshore rmb bond repurchase repo transactions we are e panding the offshore rmb repo business to also support re hypothecation and cross currency repo and the cmu omniclear will enhance the operational arrangements accordingly these enhancements will be implemented in late august secondly the southbound bond connect investor scope is e panded to include securities firms fund companies insurance companies and wealth management companies formally effective from today this will open up more channels to meet the growing demand from mainland investors addressing their needs for diversified asset allocation it will also bolster the development of hong kong s bond market by widening the investor base and enhancing market liquidity hence increasing hong kong s attractiveness to bond issuers and global investors thirdly further to the announcement in may year interest rate swaps irs contracts have already gone live early last week on june under the swap connect and irs contracts using the loan prime rate lpr as reference rate will be launched in the coming months besides we have been working on strengthening hong kong s financial infrastructure to support greater efficiency in the hong kong and mainland chinese bond markets for e ample the recent signing of a mou between cmu omniclear and lch could facilitate the wider use of cnh bonds as collateral in the international market this highlights the unparalleled role of hong kong s infrastructure in supporting investment in cnh denominated debt securities by investors from all over the world looking ahead as investors navigate geopolitical changes and search for greater diversification the bond connect will continue to serve as a key platform connecting china s bond market with the world the hkma will work closely with stakeholders to ensure that the platform will meet these changing needs by enhancing market liquidity such as cross border repo in the pipeline strengthening risk management with offshore cmof bond futures under preparation and further broadening the investment channels the continuous development of bond connect will not only deepen market integration but also reinforce hong kong s unique role

andrew bailey the meaning of reserve currency panel remarks by mr andrew bailey governor of the bank of england at the andrew crockett memorial lecture on the occasion of the bank for international settlement s annual general meeting basel june the views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the bis central bank speech july by andrew bailey pdf full te t kb pages it is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to make some remarks this afternoon this is not just to be able to follow a fascinating and timely lecture but also because i worked for andrew crockett at the bank of england nearly years ago andrew was inspiring to work for one of the deepest thinkers about international economic policy and central banking he also had a quite incautious side too he was a practitioner of one of his favourite phrases if you have never missed a plane you obviously arrive at airports too early andrew was also the creator of the financial stability forum and its first chair i want to spend my time developing a theme that has run though maury s lecture namely what has been the meaning of the term reserve currency and what does it mean today my conclusion is that it is best to think of the term as one that has evolved with the times and continues to do so thinking of it as a constant term does not help to understand its meaning i will start with the nineteenth century meaning of the term the monetary regime was the classical gold standard and convertibility of domestic currency into gold at a fi ed price was the nominal anchor of the system the term reserve therefore referred to the gold reserves that were held to enable convertibility and the promise thereof the nineteenth century bank of england spent time managing that reserve balance to create confidence in the promise of convertibility today our banknotes still carry the words i promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of nowadays it means that someone can have another banknote but under the gold standard it meant much more this system did not put as much emphasis on financial stability with the consequence that when crises occurred as they did in that time they were managed with a certain degree of adhocery hence walter bagehot wrote his famous critique of the bank there was rather more to the concept of reserve currency in this period sterling was the premier currency of international trade built on trade with the british empire but e tending further over time to the countries of the so called sterling area it is one of the questions in central bank trivial pursuit to name countries in the sterling area the collapse of this system between the wars led to the bretton woods system coming into e istence and its heyday once full convertibility was restored this system had the joint dollar gold anchor in the form of a fi ed dollar gold rate and pegging of the major currencies the consequence was a substantial growth of official dollar reserves and the further emergence thus of the dollar as the reserve currency the system therefore had a joint anchor because bretton woods solved the so called trilemma by restricting capital flows the threat of countries e hausting reserves was limited but not sufficiently so to prevent difficult devaluations at times moreover i tend to think of the triffin dilemma as posing the question what if the bluff of the dollar gold tie had been called and what would be the consequence from the early s that system broke down countries moved to free float with periodic attempts at management and a lifting of restrictions on capital controls alongside this was the emergence of the domestic anchor of monetary policy usually an inflation target the dollar had become the predominant currency of international trade and payments the role and nature of reserves had changed no longer were they a nineteenth century description of the central bank s balance sheet and its liquidity under the classical gold standard rather they became a description of so called official reserves typically but not always held by governments though often managed by central banks their role was different reflecting the changes to the solution of the trilemma as foreign e change intervention to influence e change rates came to an end the role of reserves in many countries was to act as a bulwark against pressures from capital flows as seen in the asian crisis of the late s a few numbers help here the stock of f reserves relative to global gdp increased from to between and last year during that period foreign currency reserves as a proportion of global reserve assets including gold increased from to while the dollar s share of foreign currency reserves declined from to i take four points from these figures the total stock of f reserves has increased the share of gold fell the dollar s share fell as it moved from being the anchor currency to the largest currency and the evidence further supports the view that the meaning of the term reserve currency has changed over time today with domestic monetary anchors financial stability has become the focus of international co ordination the opposite of the gold standard arrangements the meaning of reserve currency has changed again as a consequence i would point to two important features of today s system first the concept of reserve currency has a lot more to do with the supply and denomination of safe assets which act as security in the financial system and are increasingly at the heart of it this version of the concept of reserve currency has as much to do with the role of us treasuries as a safe asset that is present not just in official reserves but also to provide security and collateral in financial markets second these arrangements are backed up by the provision of contingent liquidity insurance in the form of central bank swaps and a repo facility these arrangements underpin the role and primacy of the reserve currency i will end with two points which strike me as unfinished or emerging first at least for the large economies it could be asked today what is the point of official reserves my view is that today their use is more to do with preserving financial stability in the event of stress they may be needed to support financial system liquidity in situations of e treme stress my second point as bis colleagues have emphasised is that we need to watch carefully the evolution of payments forms and whether innovation here introduces fragility into what i would call the money system if for instance stablecoins emerge as a new form of money we have to decide how to ensure the singleness of money and therefore trust in money in this world and what role the notion of reserve currency should play here to finish thank you maury for such a stimulating lecture you pushed me to think further about the meaning of reserve currency the conclusion i draw was that we need to emphasise more its adaptable nature but thereby be very clear what it means in the world of today and tomorrow thank you about the author andrew bailey more from this author related information more speeches from bank of england country page united

of the executive board of the european central bank at the conclusion of the assessment of the ecb s monetary policy strategy sintra june the views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the bis central bank speech july by christine lagarde and philip r lane pdf full te t kb pages good afternoon ecb chief economist philip lane and i welcome you to this press conference on the occasion of the conclusion of the assessment of our monetary policy strategy the governing council recently agreed on an updated monetary policy strategy statement you can find this statement on our website together with an e planatory overview note and the two occasional papers presenting the underlying analyses i will start by putting this strategy assessment into the broader conte t philip lane will then go through the updated strategy statement and e plain what has changed and why as well as what has remained unchanged following the strategy review we carried out in the governing council committed to assess periodically the appropriateness of its monetary policy strategy with the next assessment e pected in such regular assessments ensure that our framework toolkit and approach remain fit for purpose in a changing world and the world has changed significantly over the last four years some of the issues we were most concerned about back in including inflation being too low for too long have taken a rather different turn not only did we see inflation surge but some fundamental structural features of our economy and the inflation environment are changing geopolitics digitalisation the increasing use of artificial intelligence demographics the threat to environmental sustainability and the evolution of the international financial system all of those suggest that the environment in which we operate will remain highly uncertain and potentially more volatile this will make it more challenging to conduct our monetary policy and fulfil our mandate to keep prices stable during the strategy assessment we asked what do these changes mean for the way we assess the economy conduct our policy use our toolkit take our decisions and communicate them in seeking to answer this question our mindset was forward looking on the whole we concluded that our monetary policy strategy remains well suited to addressing the challenges that lie ahead but our strategy also needs to be updated and adjusted in certain areas so that the ecb can remain fit for purpose in the years to come the next assessment is e pected in with our updated strategy statement we are taking a comprehensive perspective on the challenges facing our monetary policy so that the ecb can remain an anchor of stability in this more uncertain world this is our core message to the euro area citizens we serve the new environment gives many reasons to worry but one thing they do not need to worry about is our commitment to price stability the ecb is committed to its mandate and will keep itself and its tools updated to be able to respond to new challenges let me conclude by thanking on behalf of the governing council all the colleagues across the eurosystem who have contributed to this assessment in a great team effort i now hand over to our chief economist philip lane and following his remarks we will be ready to take your questions philip r lane i m going to focus on the paragraphs of the ecb s monetary policy strategy statement what s important is that behind these paragraphs is a lot of work the base layer is the two occasional papers i m sure you ve already read the pages in those two occasional papers there s a lot of rich new analysis of many dimensions in those two occasional papers then we have the overview note which the governing council worked on collectively and which basically provides the elaboration behind these paragraphs and i would say that in these paragraphs in this review we essentially tried to review the economic assessment where are we and where are we likely to be that was one of the two work streams that essentially primarily shows up in paragraph so paragraph you might say is one paragraph but it s a very important paragraph because it essentially outlines the challenges that we may face we had a similar paragraph last time but last time the focus was essentially on a lot of factors that can give rise to a low inflation world and a low interest rate world whereas the assessment this time of the eurosystem staff behind this is that when we look where we are now in the structural changes facing the world economy we have geopolitics and a lot of this is in the direction of rolling back globalisation last time we were looking at globalisation as a force which did contribute to low inflation before the pandemic there are many dimensions to geopolitics but we are of course already living it and this is something we do think is going to shape the next five years we already mentioned digitalisation the last time but this time we re calling that as a separate and important element artificial intelligence because of course i think for a long time it has been understood that the world economy automates and digitalises that s been around for a while that s mature what s not mature and where there s really a wide range of possibilities is what does it mean as the business sector and the public sector incorporate artificial intelligence i think we had already called out demography and the threat to environmental sustainability and i think we re very correct to have done so five years ago we ve seen a lot on these fronts in these five years let me remind you without immigration the european labour force would be shrinking so demography is not just a future trend it s a year by year reality for us and then this week last week this year last year all the time we see the impact of weather shocks and the impact of the green transition by the way investment in europe in recent years would have been a lot lower without the green transition it s the one solid driver of investment for many sectors at the moment we call out all of these elements but what s critical for our conclusion for monetary policy is that it creates uncertainty it creates volatility and we think what we may be faced with is larger deviations from our target in both directions so we have this two sided risk assessment and as i go through these paragraphs essentially once we ve identified this economic assessment the natural question to ask is how do we manage it how does monetary policy manage this two sided risk and essentially in what follows we will turn to the monetary policy implications but the other thing to note about paragraph is that there is a new sentence that s the final sentence it is that we don t live in a bubble we don t say monetary policy is the only game in town and we do highlight here that a more resilient financial architecture supported by progress on the savings and investments union the completion of banking union and the introduction of a digital euro would also support the effectiveness of monetary policy in this evolving environment so in other words all of these structural changes are much more easily handled if we have a more resilient euro european and euro denominated financial system and i think that s also important and maybe helps you to understand why we as board members and more generally the governing council spend a lot of time talking about these wider issues it s not a distraction from monetary policy it s an important underpinning for monetary policy paragraph is unchanged because paragraph is setting the legal conte t we have a mandate given by the treaty and so to make the strategy statement self contained it s a reminder to you of the legal and treaty constraints we live under and that essentially remains the same as last time the third paragraph because remember in the european treaty there s not a super detailed definition of price stability so it s important and this is something that evolved over the years that in terms of measurement we re focused on the harmonised inde of consumer prices hicp and again this is stable from last time last time we highlighted that we did think a reform of the hicp to include owner occupied housing would be desirable we continue to hold that view but in the end it s for the european statistical system to make progress on that so what we say is that in the meantime we do take into account inflation measures that include estimates of the cost of owner occupied housing so in other words we create supplementary indicators these are not official data but we do take a look and these would be relevant in scenarios where house prices were rising far more quickly or far more slowly than the overall inflation rate by the way this has not been particularly the issue in recent years it would not have made a big difference in recent years but of course in principle we could be in a situation in the future where it made a difference paragraph is again largely stable from last time it s e plaining why we target not zero and that s a fairly mature topic why you want to have a safety margin we do and i think correctly this time in the final sentence of paragraph include intersectoral adjustment in the last five years we ve seen this massive change between goods prices and services prices and actually it turns out that that s a very important consideration it s a lot easier to handle an under inflation target than if you re trying to hit zero essentially if you re trying to hit zero and the price of energy compared with goods rose implicitly you need to drive down the price of goods and we know for many reasons that deflation even at the sectoral level is difficult so having a target is reinforced by including intersectoral adjustment in that list so paragraph says you need a safety margin paragraph says is the best way to maintain price stability and that our commitment is symmetric so what this symmetry means is that we consider negative and positive deviations from the target as equally undesirable the last sentence i think has been critical in these years having a clear target you may have heard us all many times say it s not somewhere in the region of it s and having that clarity is very important for anchoring expectations so i think it turned out that that choice we made to be precise about what our orientation is in the medium term is very important let me turn to a paragraph where i think there has been an important change a sensible change something that you might say sounds so sensible why are you talking about it but it s worth highlighting the update last time in we felt we needed to point out that the symmetry of the target doesn t mean that how we set monetary policy looks identical whether we re above the target or below the target and so we pointed out that if we have a lower bound issue we need to be appropriately forceful or persistent what have we learnt from these five years that remains true for below target inflation but actually it s equally true for above target inflation and what we actually did was we had a phase of being forceful so from july to september we hiked a lot and then we went into a persistent phase so from september to june we had the overview note goes into more detail about why you need the blend of forceful and persistent but when we reviewed this peers said these were important concepts in relation to the lower bound but they re equally appropriate concepts in relation to being above target it s not of course in relation to blips what we talk about here is in response to large sustained deviations so you have to first of all make the call what we see in front of us is something that s materially away from and that would remain away from unless we responded and this is why we say appropriately forceful or persistent because what e actly is appropriate depends on whether you are dealing with an upside shock a downside shock and a wider set of issues so that i think is important let me come back to this issue that we have a symmetric commitment and we re two sided but the headache is different on both sides on the downside the lower bound is the main headache on the upside and this reflects so much of the last number of years and reflects a lot of the work in the occasional papers is possible non linearities in price and wage setting what we learnt is that once inflation starts to build it can take off and it can accelerate you can get this non linear dynamic and that s why you need to be forceful on the upside that s not really true for downside shocks they tend not to accelerate but downside shocks tend to get embedded because your ability to respond on monetary policy is different going back to this point that it s not about smoothing out every deviation from and it s large sustained deviations this is very much in the spirit of the medium term orientation and that s paragraph so paragraph is stable we already had a medium term orientation i think throughout the whole history of the ecb and i think that s been very wise our commitment in line with the opening remarks from the president is that people should be able to count on our commitment to price stability if we see a deviation we will bring it back to and that s our medium term orientation there s one enrichment here which i think makes sense people often ask how long is the medium term and i think a very important discipline on that is in the final sentence now subject to maintaining anchored inflation expectations that really defines the medium term as you know in recent years we mapped that into we will make sure inflation returns to target in a timely manner you need to impose some discipline on yourself as opposed to saying the medium term is always just over the projection horizon the medium term means not so long that the anchoring of expectations is put at risk so again i think that s always been true but it s better to be e plicit about it and maybe now as journalists if you ask governing council members in the future how long the medium term is the medium term is how long it takes without putting into question the anchoring of expectations paragraph is our toolbo paragraph we already said in that our primary instrument is the set of ecb policy rates i do wonder for those of you who were involved in looking at the ecb in how many of you fully believed that as we moved away from the lower bound we would stop quantitative easing qe and we would stop forward guidance but that was in our strategy and that s what we did these are tools that make sense at the lower bound they are not tools from a stance point of view that have the same role away from the lower bound so one basic message is already in we told you a lot about how the toolbo works but we did obviously come back and look at this it s an important topic let me highlight a couple of revisions here or amplifications one is that i think we are more articulate now about when these tools come into play one is to steer the monetary policy stance when the rates are close to the lower bound that s what we said last time that s definitely a big category but the second category is or to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission march is one e ample when the world s financial market was hit by the pandemic shock central banks in general did a lot of asset purchasing refinancing operations and other elements to stabilise the transmission of monetary policy so again what i would say is either it s because we re near the lower bound or there s some big drama causing an interruption to the transmission of monetary policy but otherwise these instruments remain in the toolbo they re available but they re not used on a continuous basis and so we list out these tools just as a reminder longer term refinancing and asset purchases those two would possibly be used either way for the stance or for smoothing the transmission of policy whereas of course negative rates and forward guidance are more particular to the lower bound so there is a differentiation within that category we also said last time that we will respond fle ibly to new challenges as they arise and we can consider new instruments and of course we told you that we considered new instruments and we actually did it because we did introduce the transmission protection instrument in and then the last sentence is important because this is where a lot of the discussion in the last year has been it is to look back at these this set of instruments and on a forward basis say in the future if we ever came to these situations how would we use these instruments so we say in this important sentence the choice of which one we use or which combination we use the design because on day zero we usually have a press release or a legal act saying here s the design of our instrument and the implementation so in other words month by month how we adjust it and how we bring it to an end in terms of e it all of these number one will enable an agile response to new shocks so let s not get locked into rigid programmes that would inhibit our ability to respond to new shocks they will reflect the intended purpose so there can be differences between a stance orientated intervention and a transmission smoothing type intervention and then of course all of these will be subject to a comprehensive proportionality assessment so in considering the choice of tools the design and the implementation we need the checklist of whether this is proportional to the challenge we face so that s as i say the toolbo then paragraph is e plaining how we make decisions a lot of this is similar to last time last time we basically had to tell you that we ve decided rather than having a two pillar strategy where we have an economic pillar and a monetary pillar we make an integrated assessment and in that integrated assessment for e ample we take into account macro financial linkages financial stability and so on so a lot of that remains but maybe you might find this new sentence interesting the second sentence is that in how we make decisions we take into account not only the most likely path for inflation in the economy i e in a projection for the baseline we don t just look at the baseline but also the surrounding risks and uncertainty how do we do that including through the appropriate use of scenario and sensitivity analysis this is something we have done forever but it s probably true that it s not always visible in how we communicate and also internally of course the science of how you should do scenarios and the science of how you should make sure your decisions are robust is always evolving so we do want to make this clear and in fairness for you and for others watching us you can say i think i understand this decision in the conte t of the baseline but i have a natural question is it also robust to the risk assessment of the ecb and i think that will be a step forward in the conversation about monetary policy by the way this is already reflected importantly because as you may have noticed what we ve said in the last couple of years is that we make our decisions not only based on the inflation outlook but also in relation to underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission because those two dimensions capture a lot of risk underlying inflation captured a lot of risk when we were bringing inflation down from to the strength of monetary transmission captured a lot of risk as we moved interest rates first of all steeply upwards and then as we ve been reversing so the logic behind the three pronged reaction function that we ve been using reflects these principles paragraph reaffirms and i think everything we ve learnt from the last four years validates the assessment that in terms of price stability climate change has profound implications in terms of the structure of the economy the rise and fall of particular sectors the cycle including through the impact of weather shocks and also in terms of how the financial system is adjusting this is also a policy priority for the european union and a global challenge so we are committed to ensuring the eurosystem fully takes into account in line with the eu s goals and objectives the implications of climate change and nature degradation for monetary policy and central banking we added because we ve already added it elsewhere and nature degradation because essentially it s the same headache and in terms of our economic analysis you ve also seen it in our publications the same underlying failure to incorporate the global public good of a sustainable environment permeates that paragraph reaffirms that clear communication is centre stage of our policymaking we want effective communication at all levels and this is why we think the layered and visualised approach to monetary policy communication is essential also we want to adapt in this rapidly changing communication landscape there s more on that in the overview note and as you know the ecb has been rolling out new types of communication including espresso economics on youtube in recent times and then maybe in line with the idea that it s good housekeeping to have a regular calendar based commitment the next assessment of the appropriateness of the strategy will be in about the authors christine lagarde

government ministries group country manager for sri lanka of the world bank representatives of the european union heads and representatives of other international institutions and partner agencies other government officials international and national e perts representatives of financial institutions and associations esteemed invitees joining us virtually colleagues at the central bank ladies and gentlemen it s with great pleasure that i speak to you this morning at the launch of sustainable finance roadmap which is a milestone in the central bank s sustainable financing journey and a critical step forward in strengthening resilience inclusiveness and long term sustainability of the financial sector and the economy this moment comes at a time when the world faces profound and interconnected challenges related to environment and social wellbeing according to the network for greening the financial system ngfs estimates more than usd trillion of financial assets could be at risk globally if the current climate related impact trends continue based on the world bank estimates climate change could push an additional million of the world population towards poverty unless decisive action is taken in the sri lankan conte t it is estimated that usd billion is required for implementing the ndc s until as you all may agree the e treme weather events we have witnessed are no longer anomalies they are signs of a shifting climate that will increasingly impact our agriculture energy security infrastructure and livelihoods hence sustainable finance is no longer optional it is an economic social and environmental imperative globally and here in sri lanka it was with this global reality in mind that the central bank of sri lanka launched its first sustainable finance roadmap in that initiative set the foundation for integrating sustainability into our financial system building awareness and piloting green finance products today as we launch the sustainable finance roadmap we are reaffirming and strengthening that commitment first of all i would like to e tend my gratitude to the international finance corporation ifc for the technical guidance and the european union for collaborating with ifc for funding the project under the accelerating climate smart and inclusive infrastructure in south asia eu acsiis program which was a timely intervention as we completed five years since the launching of the first roadmap i congratulate the project team and make this a point to thank all the stakeholders who engaged in the project and provided their valuable input and e pert knowledge in developing a well balanced roadmap if i give you an essence of the conte t in which the central bank started this journey in with the joining of sbfn the landscape for sustainable financing was more focused on environmental aspect of sustainability however over the years closer to a decade many dimensions related to sustainable development have gained momentum as climate risk emerged as one of the major deterrents against financial stability it is the responsibility of the central bank to take initiatives to green the financial system in maintaining both price stability and financial stability as per the mandate vested upon cbsl climate change or the impact of climate events on the economy could be transformed into the financial sector in two ways supply side disruptions could trigger inflationary pressure weakening price stability while building up of non performing portfolios following a catastrophe which could take a toll on financial system stability through a credit crisis with the enactment of the new cbsl act inclusiveness also comes under the duties of cbsl where we have strategized how financial inclusion could be achieved climate related events are becoming more common which raises concerns over financial institutions ability to manage their risks and to continue to provide financial services in certain segments and geographies financial authorities are taking steps to integrate climate risk in their financial stability assessments for e ample climate scenario analysis climate stress testing and value chain analysis in relation to green house gas ghg emissions are carried out by the financial regulators and financial institutions in the global conte t on the other hand decarbonization efforts have reached new heights with tightened regulations especially in the european region which is challenging for the local industries catering to such markets simultaneously reporting and disclosure requirements are getting streamlined globally with the introduction of accounting standards s and s and other integrated reporting initiatives national level commitments including ndcs national adaptation plan and net zero plan were revisited and ambitious targets have been set in this backdrop the central bank policy interventions are necessary to ensure resilience while uplifting the inclusiveness among society for achieving greater prosperity particularly we have incorporated the social aspect of sustainability into the roadmap as the new cbsl act recognised inclusiveness as a duty of the central bank further the roadmap has given more emphasis to the internal risk management frameworks in addressing climate challenges in the financial sector while focusing on green initiatives as you all know the past few years have been a challenging period not only for the financial sector but for the whole economy we have made considerable progress in terms of restoring stability however the future challenges are not to be undermined i believe sustainable finance roadmap is one such policy initiative that will guide us towards how we particularly as the financial sector should strategize in terms of environmental and social challenges that may arise due to potential climate events in terms of the social aspect of sustainability the roadmap will serve for the broader theme of social justice with special emphasis on msme s vulnerable groups and gender equality national financial inclusion strategy nfis phase ii will also be implemented as part of the roadmap which is e pected to promote inclusive green financing igf we have challenges to overcome especially with inter institutional coordination and alignment with a national strategy in climate financing more emphasis on adaptation financing remains to be addressed while different avenues to facilitate blended financing where the financial institutions can collaborate with the state need to be revisited while new challenges will emerge with the evolution of the subject area implementation of the actions laid down in roadmap is very important as it will strengthen the foundation of the financial sector to gain more resilience against climate risks while uplifting financial inclusion among society we have maintained the momentum to be categorised as an advancing member country in terms of sustainable finance framework development and implementation in line with international trends and good practices as per the sbfn global brief successful implementation of rm will position sri lanka at the forefront of the sustainable financing leadership in the region at the launching of roadmap my request to all the stakeholders who have validated this document is to e tend your fullest cooperation in achieving the targets set in a timely manner and contributing to the area of sustainability both individually and collectively understanding its criticality as a nation in driving the mandate on climate combating and social inclusiveness i hope you will e tend your fullest cooperation and continue to engage with the central bank through the stakeholder committee and the working groups to be formed in near future with that i will conclude my address wishing you all the very best for your commitments and endeavours in this area in the future thank you about the author

to be a useful tool in times of market stress and at the lower bound though its effectiveness in the latter case was limited as seen in the prolonged failure to meet the inflation target to his view which i do share this highlights the need for stronger preemptive measures to avoid reaching the lower bound without raising the inflation target while recognizing that policy trade offs become more pronounced at very low rates for now interest rate adjustments suffice but balance sheet tools should remain available also for future use when that time comes we ll benefit from the lessons and data gathered likely leading to a more cautious and informed application having said this i don t dare try to replace francesco but as we are here tonight at suomen pankki s villa well fed surrounded by some of the sharpest minds in monetary policy implementation and waiting for the dessert let me share you a story that has absolutely nothing to do with interest rates liquidity tiers or central bank balance sheets it s a tale about monkeys five of them to be precise in a behavioral e periment five monkeys were placed in a cage a banana was hung enticingly from the ceiling just out of reach but with a ladder leading up to it naturally one monkey climbed the ladder but the moment he did so all the monkeys get sprayed with cold water now this was repeated with another brave monkey with the same outcome it didn t take long before they collectively realized that climbing the ladder equals group suffering so they stop trying then the researchers those mischievous minds replaced one monkey with a newcomer this fresh monkey unaware of the watery consequences made it for the banana and was immediately attacked by the others before he even reached the first step of the ladder no water was sprayed the researchers had turned off the system but naturally the enforcement continued one by one each of the original monkeys was replaced and always the newcomer tried to go for the banana and faced the consequences by being attacked by all other monkeys and learned the unpleasant lesson this went on until none of the original water sprayed monkeys remained and yet none of them went for the banana why because in their silent consensus they knew that if one of us tries to reach the banana we will all attack him but why well that s just how it s always been done now why am i telling you this at a dinner of a conference on monetary policy implementation because operational frameworks like monkey ladders carry the weight of precedent once built they are carefully tended tweaked interpreted and defended over time features introduced in response to specific conditions can petrify into unquestioned norms liquidity instruments designed for crisis fighting may persist long after the crisis has passed interest rate corridor widths collateral eligibility rules counterparty lists these can all become ladders no one dares climb even when the water has long stopped spraying of course there is wisdom in continuity we build on e perience we don t reinvent the operational wheel with every policy cycle but there s a fine line between honoring best practices and blindly preserving them that is why gatherings like this conferences that bring together practitioners policymakers and academics are not just useful they are essential they give us a chance to ask why do we do things the way we do what assumptions underlie our tools what elements of our framework are there because they work and which are there simply because they ve always been there together we explore the structure of our monetary policy operating frameworks not just to preserve them but to improve them we challenge each other share our e periences and spot the ladders we ve stopped climbing not because they re dangerous but because we ve forgotten why we ever feared them so as we enjoy this evening let s toast not only to the smooth functioning of our frameworks but also to the courage to e amine them critically and to the discussions that keep us from turning into monkeys in tailored suits thank you all for today now it s time for our final agenda item the dessert about the author

rajeshwar rao bridging the credit gap the evolution of india s credit reporting infrastructure keynote address by mr rajeshwar rao deputy governor of the reserve bank of india at the transunion cibil s credit conference mumbai july the views e pressed in this speech are those of the speaker and not the view of the bis central bank speech july by rajeshwar rao pdf full te t kb pages ladies and gentlemen good afternoon at the outset let me thank the organisers for inviting me to deliver the keynote address at this milestone event and congratulate trans union cibil tu cibil on its th anniversary credit reporting and tu cibil have grown together in india and the company has made a significant contribution in e panding the footprint of credit reporting in the country credit reporting systems today operate as a key element in the national financial architecture encouraging greater credit access supporting financial inclusion enabling effective supervision and enhancing financial stability this silver jubilee therefore also represents a significant milestone in tu cibil s ongoing contribution to strengthening this framework this also gives us an occasion to reflect on how the information gap between the credit institutions and the borrowers has been addressed over time and the possible way ahead evolution of credit information companies in india to set a conte t to the theme of this speech it may be worthwhile to reflect briefly on the evolution of credit information companies in india the reserve bank had recognised the need for establishing a credit information bureau for collection of credit information from lending institutions and for the provision of such information to the financial system and had set up a working group in for the purpose credit information bureau india ltd cibil was thereafter incorporated in and over the years three other credit information companies cics have also started their operations in india a variety of challenges had hindered wider acceptance of credit information companies over the years the key obstacles included inconsistent quality in data submitted by lenders and shortcomings in consumer protection mechanisms therefore a committee was set up in to e amine the issues hampering the sector and based on its recommendations significant policy changes were made in these included standardisation of data formats for individual corporate and micro finance borrower segments institutionalizing the mechanism of technical working group comprising of representatives from various regulated entities and introduction of data quality inde for improving data quality in the recent past our focus has been on taking regulatory measures to improve quality of data and ensure faster redressal of customer grievances several policy measures have been taken to reduce information asymmetry enhance data quality and improve customer satisfaction just to illustrate these steps included mandating availability of free full credit report ffcr to individuals appointment of internal ombudsman by cics e tending the reserve bank s integrated ombudsman scheme to cics introduction of a framework for granting compensation to customers for delayed rectification of their credit information and increasing frequency of credit reporting rbi directions have also mandated the cics to display the list of suit filed accounts of large defaulters and wilful defaulters on their website the role of data and emerging technology in enabling credit access is therefore e tremely topical and relevant at this juncture but if we were to go back in time years back lack of information and high cost of access to information hindered access to credit to large segment of the populace the financially e cluded it was in this scenario that credit reporting started to take root in the country and we have traversed a long road since then apart from greater access to secured lending the creditors gain confidence to underwrite unsecured loans facilitated by access to credit information provided by the cics as this reduces the information gap that e isted earlier between even the prime borrowers and the lenders while cics have undoubtedly played an important role in reducing the information asymmetry thereby facilitating better credit decisions they are not going to be the only game in town to source the required data as information asymmetries are also sought to be addressed through other complementary mechanisms this trend is driven by the digitalization of financial services and electronification of records which has created a large repository of data which can be used to get better handle on economic trends both micro and macro this coupled with the growth of fintechs and innovations in financial services has created business opportunities to harness alternate data sets in order to gain a better understanding of financial behaviour and credit worthiness of individuals and entities these insights can give a richer perspective than conventional analysis and provide an impetus to the measures taken to foster greater financial inclusion let me highlight a few of these developments technology led and regulator supported cersai and crilc in the central registry of securitisation asset reconstruction and security interest of india cersai was incorporated initially for operating a registration process under the provisions of sarfaesi act over the years it has developed into a complete registry containing security interest of immovable movable intangible properties and assignment of receivables by providing access to all kinds of creditors and the facility for filing of attachment orders and court orders cersai delivers a comprehensive status of any encumbered attached property the central repository of information on large credits crilc was set up in by the reserve bank to collect store and disseminate information on large credits of scheduled commercial banks all india financial institutions and certain non banking financial companies these initiatives have undoubtedly helped banks and other financial institutions in improving their credit administration besides providing vital inputs for supervisory risk assessment on build up of credit risk in the financial system digital public infrastructure dpi at the heart of the fintech revolution in india is india s digital public infrastructure dpi a framework that integrates technology markets and governance to serve public interest the dpi includes unified payments interface upi which is the flagship instant mobile digital payments system interoperable across any bank account or app aadhaar digital id for over a billion adults aadhaar payment bridge which facilitates cash transfers directly to beneficiaries bank accounts aadhaar enabled payments system aeps which is an interoperable network of biometric based cash withdrawal deposits digilocker which is an e locker for storing verifiable credentials bharat bill payments system now called bharat connect for bill fetch pay and fasttag a near field communication based toll charges and parking collections platform this is supplemented by the account aggregator framework another cog in the dpi which is a cross sectoral framework for consented financial data sharing apart from facilitating credit delivery this is an initiative towards open finance it has now come a long way and is growing rapidly with onboarding of financial institutions since guidelines were first issued in the inclusion of goods and services ta network gstn as a financial information provider under the account aggregator framework is e pected to give further impetus to cashflow based lending to msmes unified lending interface uli the latest addition in the digital public infrastructure for credit is the unified lending interface uli designed to simplify and democratize credit access by offering lenders regulated seamless access to verified borrower data the convergence of jan dhan accounts aadhar and mobile phones popularly known as the jam trinity upi and uli represents a significant advancement in india s digital lending infrastructure one of uli s standout features is its ability to tap into alternative digital data enabling access to credit even for those without formal financial histories its integration with nabard s e kcc portal is e pected to e tend access to customers of district central co operative and regional rural banks previously e cluded from formal digital channels integration of state level digitized data such as land records and cooperative databases into the uli framework would provide novel cash flow based lending solutions going forward the potential for uli to also harness data from e commerce platforms and gig economy apps could open new doors for credit inclusion for small sellers delivery workers and freelancers improved access to credit when we evaluate the outcomes of these measures we can see the significant changes and benefits over the years india s household debt as a percentage of gdp has increased and stands at percent in this rising trend is fuelled more by an e pansion in the number of borrowers rather than just through an increase in average indebtedness despite some moderation observed recently the growth in deployment of bank credit under retail personal loan category witnessed a cagr of appro imately percentage over the past five years moreover the composite financial inclusion fi inde to measure and evaluate the e tent of financial inclusion too has improved substantially from in to in in indicating progress in deepening of financial inclusion in the country this reflects two important facets of credit that need to be borne in mind first the availability of credit to individual borrowers has improved and second the improvement in the fi inde reflects reduced frictions in credit delivery with consequential improvement in financial access digital initiatives for msme sector a targeted beneficiary of increased use of data and technology in credit decisions should be the msme sector which remains the backbone of india s economy with over crore enterprises contributing nearly one third of our gdp and of e ports this sector is key to our economic future increasing the availability of credit to the msmes has been a policy priority of the reserve bank and the government of india however msmes have faced several challenges in accessing formal credit such as information asymmetry e cess documentation and lack of transparency here the role of cics has become important when commercial credit reporting is efficient creditors need to rely less on relationship lending and soft information and more on facts and fact based analyses based on credit reports and other credit reporting products rise of fintech ecosystem it needs to be recognised that of late fintech players have emerged as powerful enablers transforming how credit reaches previously unserved and underserved populations by leveraging the power of technology they have significantly lowered the cost and comple ity of delivering financial services to the last mile this has not only improved user e perience but also addressed persistent challenges that had kept many outside the formal credit fold importantly we are seeing a growing collaboration between fintechs and traditional financial institutions this partnership is particularly impactful in credit origination and supply chain finance where it bridges gaps created by physical infrastructure and human resource constraints in remote and rural areas for e ample in fy fintechs have processed appro imately of small ticket personal loans of less than lakh by count open credit enablement network and open network for digital commerce the open credit enablement network ocen that facilitates interactions among lenders borrowers and loan service providers effectively uniting all participants within the credit ecosystem on a common platform to streamline credit delivery is also poised to be a significant part of the fintech landscape it is e pected to enable lenders to make more informed credit decisions by utilizing alternative data sources such as cash flow information going forward there is a promising scope for deeper integration between ocen and the open network for digital commerce ondc such interoperability could democratise credit access further and open new avenues for msmes to participate in digital commerce fostering broader economic growth on multiple fronts central bank digital currency cbdc for credit disbursement the proposed use of programmable cbdc for credit disbursement is another pioneering initiative one commercial bank s pilot for tenant farmer lending under kisan credit cards where programmable cbdc ensures end use monitoring looks promising even without land records tenant farmers are being e tended formal credit based on livelihood activity tracking if successful this model could be replicated for collateral free loans to micro enterprises street vendors and artisans where end use assurance allows for responsible productive lending the digital nature of such disbursements also creates valuable digital footprints which can enable further lending and reduce dependence on government schemes leveraging tokenisation for credit delivery tokenisation i e generating and recording a digital representation of financial or real assets on a programmable platform could be an option that can offer enhanced efficiency transparency and accessibility and may be seen as the next step following dematerialisation and digitalisation it could favour small and medium enterprises smes access to credit by narrowing the information gap further smes could improve their collateral offering by tokenising real assets or trade receivables thus improving their standing in the credit markets tokenisation may also enable simultaneous asset transfer and payment in a financial transaction minimizing counterparty risk and thereby considerably reducing the need for collateral role of ai ml in facilitating credit delivery one of the main challenges in the provision of credit facility especially among underprivileged populations is the absence of credit history by using artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml algorithms can evaluate alternative data from diverse sources to determine creditworthiness more accurately in fact it seems that time is not far when alternative data will no longer be alternate but it will be the mainstream this advancement would allow lenders to e tend credit to individuals who were once deemed ineligible use of ai ml could simplify the disbursement process by automating credit assessments and risk evaluations which not only accelerates fund distribution but also cuts administrative costs making it practical to offer small loans even in remote regions moreover ai models e cel at uncovering previously hidden insights in data enabling financial institutions to more precisely forecast their clients funding requirements and creditworthiness they also streamline compliance workflows such as know your customer kyc procedures which significantly cuts operational costs and increases their speed of lending microfinance and microloans which serve as crucial support systems for underserved communities are likely to be the biggest beneficiary of this advancement grameen credit score another initiative that is on the anvil is the grameen credit score this score will be in addition to the existing credit score and will be specifically designed to enhance financial inclusion in rural areas particularly for members of self help groups shgs it aims to address the limitations of existing generic credit scoring systems by creating a tailored framework for assessing the creditworthiness of rural borrowers this measure can improve access to formal credit for rural populations including farmers and marginalized communities role played by the reserve bank in this dynamically evolving scenario the reserve bank has been endeavouring to create an enabling regulatory environment for fostering innovation and ensuring financial system integrity with a view to put in place a regulatory framework for fintechs that maintains a balance between ma imising their creative potential while minimising the idiosyncratic risks they pose to the financial system the reserve bank issued a framework for self regulatory organisation s in the fintech sector in the reserve bank innovation hub a wholly owned subsidiary of rbi commenced an initiative to foster a vibrant infrastructure for facilitating the progress of fintechs in the country the initiative fintech and startup acceleration fast aims to connect the stakeholders viz the startups incubators accelerators investors regulators and banks and financial institutions to accelerate innovation and financial inclusion through the harbinger initiative reserve bank is encouraging the global innovation community to solve real world problems with a special focus on inclusive design and accessibility for differently abled persons in the digital finance journey to foster continuous innovation we have made the regulatory sandbo on tap and theme neutral even as we embrace these sweeping changes we must remain cognizant of the need for addressing issues around data accuracy data security and model risk these could present significant challenges in the effective deployment of data driven systems inaccurate or incomplete data can undermine the reliability of analytical outputs and decision making processes while poor data security can e pose organizations to breaches resulting in legal liabilities and reputational damage additionally the use of comple ai and machine learning models introduces concerns around model risk especially when these models are not thoroughly tested validated or monitored for biases and performance drifts rigorous validation protocols continuous monitoring and robust governance frameworks are essential to ensure that these models remain fair transparent and aligned with regulatory and ethical standards while we should be willing to embrace new technologies and modern regulatory approaches the core values integrity transparency and commitment to public service should drive our innovation and initiatives towards financial inclusion innovation needs to be responsible and accountable it should not be at the cost of an individual s rights regarding the use of their personal data looking ahead the path ahead is filled with opportunity and responsibility for the cics let me outline two critical enablers i e i enhancing data freshness and ii improving data quality currently credit data is refreshed on a fortnightly basis we must aspire to more frequent updates real time or near real time credit reporting will improve underwriting precision enable timely reflection of borrower actions like loan closures or repayments and deliver a superior consumer e perience this shift requires investments in technology process reengineering and change management but the rewards transparency efficiency and trust far outweigh the costs similarly data quality is the bedrock of responsible lending and reserve bank has always emphasised the importance of accuracy in regulatory submissions it has been prescribed that cics shall provide a data quality inde score to the credit institutions cis on a monthly basis to facilitate improvement in the quality of data submitted by cis another key challenge is identity standardization cics rely on credit institutions to provide accurate and validated ids without this duplication and misreporting remain risks we must move towards a unique borrower identifier which is secure verifiable and consistent across the system we stand on the cusp of a transformative financial era where technology policy and innovation converge to democratise credit access various initiatives collaborative partnerships and sustained regulatory support are laying the foundation for a more inclusive resilient and sustainable economy but at the heart of a sustainable credit landscape lies an empowered consumer which is enabled when we have a financially aware and literate customer while regulations mandate transparency and awareness the responsibility needs to be fulfilled by all of us financial literacy cannot be achieved through a one time campaign it has to be a sustained commitment for all the institutions and entities involved while the institutions in the financial system have done commendable work the journey is far from complete the setting up of credit information companies was in one sense the starting point of this journey of financial inclusion and democratisation of credit even as the journey continues the role of the cics remains integral and important in realizing the vision of total financial inclusion thank you inputs provided by jyoti prakash sharma rituraj and tarique ansari are gratefully acknowledged report of

money marketeers of new york university new york new york share thank you john and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today my purpose this evening is to e plain why i believe that the federal open market committee fomc should reduce our policy rate by basis points at our next meeting i used to tell my junior research colleagues that presentations are not murder mysteriesâ just tell the audience up front who did it by telling them the main point so let me follow my own advice and state up front the reasons i believe we should cut the policy rate at our meeting in two weeks first tariffs are one off increases in the price level and do not cause inflation beyond a temporary surge standard central banking practice is to look through such price level effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored which they are second a host of data argues that monetary policy should be close to neutral not restrictive real gross domestic product gdp growth was likely around percent in the first half of this year and is e pected to remain soft for the rest of much lower than the median of fomc participants estimates of longer run gdp growth meanwhile the unemployment rate is percent near the committee s longer run estimate and headline inflation is close to our target at just slightly above percent if we put aside tariff effects that i believe will be temporary taken together the data imply the policy rate should be around neutral which the median of fomc participants estimates is percent and not where we areâ to percentage points above percent my final reason to favor a cut now is that while the labor market looks fine on the surface once we account for e pected data revisions private sector payroll growth is near stall speed and other data suggest that the downside risks to the labor market have increased with inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate let me e plain my reasoning by starting with my view of economic activity given the ups and downs of monthly indicators of gdp this year we can best get a view of the performance of the economy by combining the first and second quarter numbers with the data in hand estimates suggest that real gdp increased at an annual rate of about percent in the first half of this year compared with percent in the second half of that comparison is important not only for the e tent of the slowdown which is considerable but also because it is well below most estimates of the potential growth rate of the economy based on forward looking indicators i don t e pect a rebound in the second halfâ in fact most forecasts suggest that real gdp growth will remain around percent at an annual rate while the recent ta bill has a significant number of elements that will spur economic growth in the future not much of those effects will show up this year the slowdown in gdp is evident in consumer spending which constitutes about two thirds of economic activity after hovering near percent last year real personal consumption e penditures pce growth is estimated to have stepped down to percent in the first half of this year this morning the commerce department announced june retail sales the data are consistent with this forecast as the increase is on the heels of a couple of soft monthly readings as we move forward this year consumer spending is e pected to continue to grow at a similar pace tempered by the e pected slowing in growth of real disposable income because of the temporary effects of tariff increases i will say more about tariffs when i discuss inflation but in assessing the near term momentum of the economy tariffs could well be a factor turning to the soft data this picture of declining momentum is consistent with what i am hearing from my business contacts and other sources the fed s july th beige book reported mi ed evidence on economic activity across federal reserve districts with reporting slight or modest gains and the remaining having flat or declining activity this mi ed news is also found in surveys of purchasing managers where there is a continuing contraction in manufacturing and a slight e pansion in nonmanufacturing activity given that firms outside manufacturing represent the large majority of businesses this implies a modest e pansion in activity now let s talk about the labor market the headline numbers from the june jobs report looked reassuringâ the unemployment rate stands at percent within the range it has been for the past year and payroll gains were reported as essentially the same as in may but looking a little deeper i see reasons to be concerned half of the payroll gain came from state and local government a sector of employment that is notoriously difficult to seasonally adjust this time of year in contrast private payroll employment grew just a much smaller gain than in the previous two months and that is consistent with other surveys you might have read about that found a drop in private sector employment i focus on private sector employment not only because it is the lion s share of employment but also because it is a better guide to the cyclical movement in employment than counting public and private sector together as i used to tell my students the federal reserve s job should be to ma imize private sector employment not government employment and there is another reason to cite the slowdown in private sector hiring a pattern in data revisions in recent years tells us that the private payroll data are being overestimated and will be revised down significantly when the benchmark revision occurs in early accounting for the anticipated revision to the level of employment in march and e trapolating forward private sector employment gains last month were much closer to zero this is why i say private sector payroll gains are near stall speed and flashing red this is only one month of data i realize and one possible factor in the slowdown in private sector hiring could be a deceleration in net immigration this year although it will take time to get a clear picture of how immigration is affecting employment but other data support the idea of a slowdown in hiring there are widespread media reports of the difficulty new college graduates are encountering in finding jobs and in fact the unemployment rate for new grads is at a year high far above the level before the pandemic looking across the soft and hard data i get a picture of a labor market on the edge the job openings and labor turnover survey reports continued low rates of firing but also low rates of hiring i suspect this is a hangover of a labor market that was very tight after the pandemic leaving employers resistant to let go of qualified workers for fear of renewed labor shortages that said purchasing managers report caution and even some pauses on hiring the june th beige book reported declining labor demand in every single federal reserve district and the july th beige book emphasized that labor demand continued to be less than labor supply in many industries with hiring already low at a certain point declining demand would overcome any instinct to hold on to workers and if that attitude does shift it implies that a larger and more sudden reduction in payrolls and an increase in the unemployment rate are a risk to sum up here i see the hard and soft data on economic activity and the labor market as consistent the economy is still growing but its momentum has slowed significantly and the risks to the fomc s employment mandate have increased let s turn to the inflation data in the past two days we received june consumer and producer price data that give us a good idea of the inflation rate based on pce the fomc s benchmark for monetary policy after several months of readings that moved the month inflation rate closer to the fomc s target the consumer price inde and the producer price inde suggest that total pce inflation moved up to around percent in june and core inflation likewise rose to roughly percent i believe these data reflect some modest effect from tariff increases which began in february and i believe there are further tariff induced increases to inflation to come later this year with the asterisk that there remains a lot of uncertainty about how trade agreements or escalations in trade conflicts may affect that outcome to understand how tariffs are affecting prices i have been following not only the bureau of labor statistics monthly data but also studies of high frequency price data for e ample some researchers this year are tracking the short run price impact of tariffs on goods prices in real time by e amining product level price data from online stores of large u s retailers using data through mid july they find that on net imported goods prices have increased modestly while domestic goods prices are little changed looking across country of origin chinese goods imports have seen the most persistent and steady price increases that said to date the data point to very small goods price increases relative to the size of the tariff rates this finding is consistent with my view that a large share of tariff increases won t be passed through to consumers my presumption has been that consumers will have to pay about one third of the price increases from higher tariffs with the remainder split between foreign suppliers and u s importers so if there is a permanent increase to import tariffs of about percent i e pect this will raise pce inflation three tenths of percent this year and that this increase would fade over the next year or so i can think of a couple of other reasons that may limit the impact on consumers the first is that the slowing down of the rollout of many tariffs with multiple postponements for continuing negotiations may be giving u s importers time to substitute finished or intermediate goods to domestic suppliers or foreign sources subject to lower tariffs a second reason is that faced with the slowing economy that i have described and the likelihood that tariffs will be weighing on consumer spending foreign producers and importers may be finding ways to hold the line on prices to maintain their presence on store shelves and hold on to customers in fact slowing demand increases competition for all firms and consumers may benefit finally despite all of the discussion of supply chain disruptions tariff effects on supply chains are completely different than what happened during the pandemic in the pandemic supply chains were actually broken many workers were not working factories were idle and waves of covid were hitting at asynchronous times across the globe in contrast in the case of the higher tariffs we know e actly where things are being produced and nothing is brokenâ firms are simply arguing about prices and who will eat the tariffs once that gets resolved goods will flow naturally across the globe but potentially using different routes it is possible of course that tariffs may have a larger effect on inflation than i e pect but that won t affect my view of the implications for monetary policy as i have said many times tariff increases are a one time boost to prices that do not sustainably increase inflation in the absence of an unanchoring of inflation expectations and an acceleration of wage growth which we have not seen tariffs won t and can t permanently increase the inflation rate what does this mean for monetary policy research shows that central bankers shouldâ and in fact doâ look through price level shocks to avoid needlessly tightening policy in times like these and damaging the economy the key question for monetary policy right now is what we can discern about the underlying rate of inflationâ that is the rate e cluding tariffsâ based on the fundamentals of the economy federal reserve board staff has done work to try to estimate tariff effects on pce prices using that methodology if i subtract estimated tariff effects from the reported inflation data i find the inflation numbers for the past few months would have been quite close to our percent goal you re not going to hear mission accomplished from me but what this tells me is that underlying inflation has been lower than what is reported and close to our objective besides tariffs i don t e pect an undesirable sustained increase in inflation from other forces among the reasons for this are that the rate of growth in labor compensation is down considerably in the past year or two and with the softening labor market i do not e pect workers will be able to get large wage increases going forward combining this with solid rates of productivity growth implies inflation should continue around percent two more points support my inflation outlook and i will only summarize them here since i discussed them at length in my june outlook speech the first addresses the question of whether i could be making the same kind of mistake my fomc colleagues and i made in and in e pecting inflation increases to be only transitory when they turned out to be persistent but unlike then there is no pandemic disrupting labor goods and services supply around the world and economic growth is now slow and slowing rather than e panding rapidly these differences bring me to the second point which is that unlike in and when expectations of future inflation rose today the measures of expectations i watch remain firmly anchored to sum up tariffs have boosted and will continue to boost inflation a bit above the fomc s percent objective this year but policy should look through tariff effects and focus on underlying inflation which seems to be close to the fomc s percent goal and i do not see any concern for forces driving it persistently higher as i hope will be evident by now the evidence of a slowing economy and all the factors i have cited weighing on economic activity mean that the risks to the fomc s employment mandate are greater and sufficient to warrant an adjustment in the stance of monetary policy based on june s summary of economic projections the current target range for the federal funds rate of to percent is to basis points above the participants median estimates of the longer run federal funds rate of percent while i sometimes hear the view that policy is only modestly restrictive this is not my definition of modestly in fact the distance that must be traveled to reach a neutral policy setting weighs heavily on my judgment that the time has come to resume moving in that direction in june a majority of fomc participants believed it would be appropriate to reduce our policy rate at least two times in and there are four meetings left i also believeâ and i hope the case i have made is convincingâ that the risks to the economy are weighted toward cutting sooner rather than later if the slowing of economic and employment growth were to accelerate and warrant moving toward a more neutral setting more quickly then waiting until september or even later in the year would risk us falling behind the curve of appropriate policy however if we cut our target range in july and subsequent employment and inflation data point toward fewer cuts we would have the option of holding policy steady for one or more meetings for this reason i believe it makes sense to cut the fomc s policy rate by basis points two weeks from now and looking to later this year if as i e pect underlying inflation remains in checkâ with headline inflation data reporting modest temporary increases from tariffs that are not unanchoring inflation e pectationsâ and the economy continues to grow slowly i would support further basis point cuts to move monetary policy toward neutral the views e pressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the federal reserve board or the federal open market committee return to te t the fed s beige books are available on the board s website at return to te t the employment services firm adp reported that private sector employment declined by

bureau of economic research summer institute digital economics and artificial intelligence cambridge massachusetts share watch live thank you avi it is an honor to be back with you at the nber summer institute thanks to you erik and catherine for organizing these insightful and thought provoking sessions this summer artificial intelligence ai is advancing across the globe and permeating every corner of the economy at an incredibly rapid rate this has significant implications for federal reserve leaders both as policymakers and managers of the organization ai is transforming the economy including by accelerating how quickly we generate ideas and making workers more efficient and that in turn will affect both sides of our dual mandate of ma imum employment and price stability ai also is beginning to affect the way we conduct economic research within the federal reserve system with the potential to make some tasks more efficient harness nontraditional data in new ways and broaden and deepen economic analysis i believe we are at an inflection point as i have stated before i like some of you here today see ai as the next general purpose technology gpt as many of you in this room know and have written about gpts like the printing press or electric power matter immensely to innovation similar to those seminal advances ai will likely spread throughout the economy more broadly spark innovation and improve over time among large language models llms the highest scores on benchmark intelligence tests have almost doubled over the past months according to the artificial analysis intelligence inde the competition to improve is fierce the leaderboard for the ai lab offering the best model switched si times in the past half a year and the technology is diffusing rapidly chatgpt launched about three years ago and now more than half a billion users engage with the internet based llm weekly llms are super cool and grab the headlines but there is a lot more to ai which can be an important driver of productivity advances in multimedia generation is another way to think of ai s fast advancement it took human creators decades to move from silent pictures to talkie movies ai models accomplished this advance in less than a year ai is poised to alter the contours of the global economy in doing so it has the potential to materially affect both sides of the fed s dual mandate on the ma imum employment side of the mandate ai can generate new tasks and jobs and possibly eliminate others similar to many past technological innovations on the price stability side of our mandate ai can improve productivity which can lower inflationary pressures but it can also boost prices in the interim as ai adoption may lead to a surge in aggregate investment studying the net effects of ai on the economy over time will be critical to setting appropriate monetary policy however at the fed we are not only considering ai s implications for the economy but also employing strategies to harness the technology s power inside our walls commensurate with rapid improvements in ai its adoption is accelerating across government and industry as a result there is an urgency for the fed to both study ai s effects and capture more of its benefits to maintain a highly productive workforce and e tract additional insights from new economic analysis having spent much of my career studying the innovation production function and collecting and e amining data on the economic effects of technology productivity and innovation i am coupling caution with this optimism this is consistent with my view when i was a research associate here at nber and when i first spoke about ai at the nber ai meeting in toronto in before i joined the board of governors while i see ai adoption as broadly beneficial to the economy and society i know from economic history and the history of technology that there could be many multidimensional challenges to adopting it with that in mind i will start by offering general principles i believe guide our society s engagement with ai ne t i will describe recent progress on ai research at the fed i will then say a bit about both the opportunities and constraints i see affecting the wider adoption of ai finally i will offer some brief remarks on how ai factors into my thinking on monetary policy responsible ai adoption i want to start by stressing that any organization engaging with this technology should take a thoughtful and structured approach to ai adoption i can offer four guiding principles for what i view as responsible ai adoption first and foremost is establishing strong governance and risk management a central tenet of good governance should be the mindset that humans are in the loop because it ensures that people guide ai rather than allow ai to guide us in a speech last year i told a story about how benjamin franklin lost a game of chess to a machine called the mechanical turk of course there was a human chess master hidden inside what might seem like a silly tale contains an important lesson for organizations and governments deploying ai like the mechanical turk ultimately the human inside the machine is still in charge relatedly organizations also must be careful about privacy cybersecurity and leakage of confidential and internal information a second principle is that education and training of staff are critical to get and keep employees at the technological frontier a third principle is empowerment teams within organizations should be encouraged to learn by doing and engage hands on with ai technologies in controlled environments finally a fourth principle is e perimentation organizations should maintain a spirit of openness while retaining the ability to halt projects that do not meet rigorous standards ai research at the fed like many other leading organizations and researchers around the world the federal reserve is working hard to understand ai s implications for our mission and our own work to be clear the fomc is not using ai in developing or setting policy but rather to aid staff in their other tasks such as writing coding and research for e ample we have been deepening our understanding of the capabilities of llms and other machine learning models to produce economic insights several fed papers document what we are learning board economists wendy dunn and nitish sinha with coauthors ellen meade and raakin kabir found that llms have surprisingly good understanding of economic topics discussed in the fomc minutes in a recent paper board economist paul soto measured ai research and development by e amining firms earnings conference calls using deep learning richmond fed economist anne hansen with coauthors john horton sophia kazinnik daniela puzzello and ali zarifhonarvar found partial success in simulating the survey of professional forecasters panel using an llm and create synthetic forecasters that often achieve superior accuracy particularly at medium and long term horizons a paper by mary chen matthew dehaven isabel kitschelt seung jung lee and martin sicilian used machine learning techniques on a variety of unstructured te tual data to identify and forecast financial crises another paper by leland crane emily green molly harnish will mcclennan paul soto betsy vrankovich and jacob williams harnessed the ability of an open weight model to read work adjustment and retraining notifications to create a real time measure of layoffs as our researchers e amine llms and other machine learning techniques critically some research has demonstrated the benefits of ai and other research has provided important insights about its limits and where we should be careful about ai by actively engaging with and learning about ai tools in our research we not only enhance our analytical capabilities but also gain invaluable insights into the broader economic implications of ai researchers at the fed are also e amining the state of ai adoption and the potential of ai to affect our economy a timely indicator of generative ai genai adoption in the u s has been developed by st louis fed economist ale ander bick along with his coauthors adam blandin and david deming through a repeated survey they also find that so far genai adoption for uses outside of work has been faster than personal computer pc adoption after its introduction in the workplace they find genai adoption has happened at a similar pace as occurred with pcs work from david byrne and paul soto along with coauthors martin baily and aidan kane suggests that genai has the potential to be a gpt and could benefit the economy in other ways too such as by being an invention that itself leads to more innovation in addition fed staff from across our divisions keep abreast with the rapid developments in genai by engaging regularly with other researchers and experts from academia other central banks and the industry through various seminars workshops interviews and invited presentation series simultaneously the research at the fed is proceeding deliberately and cautiously as many ai tools are not yet ready to be put into production for e ample leland crane akhil karra and paul soto show that when it comes to real time analysis llms suffer from look ahead bias and frequently get confused by the vintage nature of economic data releases even for historical analysis the researchers note from the perspective of historical analysis an llm may not reliably recall the details of real time data flow during historical episodes limiting the reliability of historical analysis the speed of adoption our e perience with ai at the fed is also informative about why we are not seeing more widespread adoption of ai in the economy despite its remarkable pace of improvement and the apparently large potential economic gains first as in all industries grappling with ai the workforce must be trained to take advantage of a rapidly changing technology that is strikingly different from previous technologies often the premise of technology has been to automate routine tasks where the steps involved are predetermined the premise of ai is different from technologies of the past ai promises to augment areas of work involving human judgement which do not follow any predetermined steps thus education and training must evolve second large organizations learn to use new tools through hands on e perimentation and shared e periences and it takes time for the knowledge to diffuse some of these are planned and organized while others are more organic and spontaneous for e ample earlier this year the board hosted an ai e po where ai early adopters shared their e periences with ai and innovative ai use cases events such as this showcase cross functional cross organizational collaboration among participants throughout the federal reserve system and demonstrate how ai driven solutions could address challenges in areas such as economic analysis financial stability and operations these venues provide e cellent avenues for sharing successes and failures in trying out different use cases and in many cases enable the broader community to engage with prototypes of ai applications in addition to demystifying ai and encouraging its use these events try to establish and promote cultural norms of responsible ai usage which generates ideas related to the types of problems ai is better or worse at solving finally organizations will also have a rational desire to be selective about which advances to adopt when the technology is rapidly changing for e ample we are seeing that some highly effective prompting strategies for older models are no longer necessary for thinking models as with any new general purpose technology there is likely to be an e tended period of learning by doing this will be particularly important for the high profile llm models with these models even the developers are not fully aware of their capabilities and organizations including the fed learn about their abilities and limitations only once they are put to use implications for monetary policy given what we know as well as what we learn from researchers like you we are thinking carefully about the implications of ai for monetary policy as ai filters through the economy it has the potential to affect both sides of our dual mandate in different ways as with other technological innovations ai is poised to reshape our labor market which in turn could affect our notion of ma imum employment or our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment i see it as likely that ai will allow workers to be more productive while also changing the tasks associated with any given job as with many technological breakthroughs a certain set of jobs may be replaced we must recognize the challenges and potential pain this may bring and we are watching this closely a successful response to these disruptions will be of paramount importance but lies outside the mandate of monetary policy fortunately new types of employment whether tasks or occupations are also being created in terms of price stability ai is likely to boost productivity and could help the economy achieve higher growth while reducing inflationary pressures because those productivity improvements can counter labor cost increases in addition the ability of ai to process and analyze ever larger amounts of data will likely lead to advances in scientific research and innovation resulting in an increased arrival rate of ideas further amplifying its effect on productivity as i have noted in recent speeches it is possible that the disinflationary effect of ai could over time counter any factors putting upward pressure on inflation it is also possible that ai could boost prices in the interim as adoption of the technology might require a surge in aggregate investment i am constantly monitoring incoming data the ever evolving outlook and a broad range of risks to both sides of the dual mandate i tend to be cautiously optimistic when i anticipate what ai could bring to the economy but much uncertainty remains as i have laid out for my institution specifically and the economy broadly ai is a technology that is rapidly evolving and it is good to be humble about our understanding of its e act effects on our economy and the timing of those effects conclusion to conclude i see us at a moment of inflection where ai is being deployed as a general purpose technology babies born today will ask what life was like before llms just as today s college students quiz us about what life was like before the internet and mobile phones this is a moment for e citement and optimism but also one we are taking seriously at the federal reserve as i have described ai will both change the economy for which we set policy and change how we can best operate as a central bank much more remains to be learned and understood about how ai will affect our economy and our everyday lives this is why gatherings and discussions like these in the th session of the nber summer institute are so important i am e cited to learn about the careful and insightful research presented by former colleagues

speech pdf please enable javascript if it is disabled in your browser or access the information through the links provided below july a view of the housing market and u s economic outlook governor adriana d kugler at the housing partnership network symposium washington d c share watch live thank you robin and thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on the important topic of housing and how housing fits in with the broader economy first i want to step back and say that housingâ our homesâ has a central role in our lives beyond what statistical reports capture housing matters greatly for our welfare because shelter is a basic human necessity our homesâ be it city apartments farmhouses passed through generations or suburban dwellingsâ are among the most significant places in our lives in terms of household finances housing is an important source of wealth for many american families housing also supports access to good jobs because the jobs people can take depend on where they live and how far they need to commute in addition the housing sector matters a great deal to the economy as a whole and it is an important channel through which monetary policy is transmitted that is why i study it closely as a member of the federal open market committee fomc from the perspective of the labor market many workers have ties to housing related sectors including construction real estate and the mortgage finance industry and because housing is a large fraction of household wealth the housing market influences consumer spending from the price stability perspective shelter has a large weight in measures of inflation specifically shelter is currently percent of the e penditures in the basket used to calculate the personal consumption e penditures pce price inde which is the fomc s preferred inflation measure today i will discuss several aspects of housing affordability in the u s a topic that i know is important to many of you as it is to me when studying affordability it is important to distinguish between the cost of shelter by which i mean the cost of occupying a home and the costs of purchasing and owning a home i will discuss each of these in turn with the common theme being that both are elevated from a historical perspective ne t i will discuss some supply and demand factors that e plain how we got to this point and offer some thoughts on how these influences might evolve finally i will discuss my overall outlook of the u s economy and its implications for monetary policy cost of shelter i will start with a discussion of the cost of shelter which is not only needed for survival but is also a large portion of household budgets because of this increases in shelter prices leave less for families to spend otherwise it is common to measure the price of shelter with rents because rent reflects the price of occupying a home rents surged early in the pandemic recovery rising percent over the months ending in december this year rent growth eased to percent over the months ending in may the recent increase in multifamily construction has contributed to this moderation for lower end properties we have not seen as much of a cooling in rental inflation in part because new construction has been aimed at the high end of the market even with the slowdown in rent growth rents continue to rise faster than overall inflation as was the case before the pandemic nevertheless rents have not risen at a faster pace than household incomes the constant quality cost of a rental unit relative to the median family income is currently no higher than its average from to the share of renters spending more than percent of their income on rent was about the same in as it was in about percent in both years of course this fraction is high indicating that rental housing is a large e pense for many families this ratio is significantly higher for certain groups in percent of hispanic households spent more than percent of their income on rent while percent of black households spent that share for households whose head did not attend college the figure is percent cost of homeownership while shelter is a necessity homeownership is an opportunity because it is a pathway for families to build wealth it also provides a greater sense of stability because owner occupants do not have to worry about a landlord deciding not to renew the lease like renting the costs of purchasing and owning a house are elevated the cost of homeownership is related to several factors one is the cost of purchasing a home like rent house price growth has slowed from the fast pace seen a few years ago and this slowing has been more pronounced for higher priced homes zillow s inde for high value homes increased percent per year over the past three years whereas it increased percent per year for low value homes despite this slowdown the level of prices is quite high even relative to income the ratio of house prices to median family income is about percent higher than its average from to in addition the costs associated with owning a home are also elevated mortgage rates have ranged between and percent in the past several years property ta es have risen along with home values homeowners insurance premiums have increased as insurers seek to offset e penditures tied to recent natural disasters and the rising cost of replacing structures federal reserve board staff research shows that factoring in high house prices mortgage rates property ta es and homeowners insurance the costs of owning a home relative to median income in were at the highest level seen since given these costs it is no surprise that some families cannot afford a home board staff research shows that increases in mortgage rates reduce purchases by lower income borrowers especially low income first time homebuyers and indeed the homeownership rate of heads of households younger than decreased from to this decline is a partial reversal of changes seen in the previous few years when a combination of very low interest rates and fiscal support caused ownership rates to rise yet on net the ownership rate for several groups remains above levels recorded before the pandemic in homeownership rates for household heads aged to were percent percentage points above their level the ownership rates for black households were percentage points higher and the rate for hispanic households was percentage points higher demand factors the relative affordability of housing is the outcome of the forces of supply and demand let me first focus on the long run trends on the demand side where household growthâ that is the change in the number of households over timeâ plays an important role household growth is a function of population growth and household size in the years before the pandemic the u s population rose slightly less than percent a year immediately following the pandemic population grew at a faster rate reflecting a higher volume of immigration that trend has since reversed academic research e amining immigration flows finds that rent growth increases in the short run after a wave of immigration but these rent increases may not persist if the housing supply e pands over time to meet the increase in housing demand in fact a study found that increases in immigration do lead to more residential construction in terms of the whole population the census bureau projects that population growth will ease over the next years but remain positive based on mortality rates birth rates and the age distribution of the population thus population growth should put less upward pressure on demand for housing going forward let me turn to some cyclical forces on the housing demand side with some factors pushing demand in opposite directions a strong labor market for several years has fueled demand for both renting and owning housing while the recent increase in mortgage rates and other costs of ownership have damped demand for owning supply factors turning to housing supply it is no surprise to those in this room that it has been increasing at too slow of a rate relative to demand research shows that growth of the housing stock has declined steadily since the s and s specifically it estimates that if the housing stock had e panded at the same rate from to as it did from to there would be million more housing units in the u s research finds that local regulations are an important factor constraining the housing supply leading to higher house prices in response some state and local governments have begun to enact policy changes aimed at rela ing these supply restrictions for e ample in minneapolis enacted a large scale zoning reform that eliminated parking requirements for new development encouraged apartment development in commercial corridors and permitted duple and triple construction on all residential lots these zoning reforms may have boosted construction in minneapolis other states and cities have also implemented policies intended to increase the number of housing units but it is still too early to tell whether these changes will meaningfully affect house prices or rents material and labor costs for home construction have increased about percent in real changes at the national level could further increase those costs anecdotal reports including those in the beige book suggest that changes in immigration policy are starting to restrict the supply of construction workers research has found that past declines in immigration have reduced residential construction while increasing housing prices in changes to date there has been some effect on homebuilder costs the national association of home builders estimates tariff policy including tariffs on steel and aluminum has increased the cost of new construction by about percent of the average price of a new home and additional tariffs such as the one proposed on imported lumber could raise construction costs further another aspect of housing supply is the number of homes for sale elevated interest rates have made it much less appealing for existing owners who have a mortgage with a low fi ed rate to sell and purchase a different house because doing so would require them to take out a new mortgage at a much higher rate therefore the supply of existing homes for sale in the past few years has been much lower than normal board staff research shows that this rate lock in effect has boosted house prices in markets that were already tight in because the decrease in homes for sale was proportionally larger than the decrease in the number of potential buyers considering all these factors in concert the housing market has gone through some pronounced swings over the past four years looking through these ups and downs growth in demand for shelter has continued to outpace supply putting upward pressure on rents across a wide range of locations and types of families although rent growth has not been faster than income growth rental e penditures are still a large fraction of income for many households house prices have risen too and combined with elevated mortgage rates and increases in other ownership costs the costs of owning a home are high relative to americans incomes looking forward growth in housing demand may soften over the second half of this decade because of a slowdown in population growth but even with this softening it is not clear that growth in the housing supply will be large enough to meet demand prospects for house prices and rents over the next few years also depend materially on the economic outlook to which i will turn now economic outlook i will start by saying that while my discussion so far has focused on the housing market i look at economic conditions across the entire economy and in every region of the country when making monetary policy decisions thus i pursue the monetary policy that i believe will achieve our dual mandate goals of ma imum employment and price stability for all americans overall i see the labor market as stable and resilient and economic activity moderating some in contrast i see upward pressure on inflation from trade policies and i e pect additional price increases later in the year while i am monitoring policy developments in many areas i continue to see trade developments as the key drivers of the u s economic outlook starting with price stability based on data received this week it is estimated that the headline pce price inde rose percent on a month basis in june a somewhat stronger gain than the percent recorded in may core inflation which e cludes volatile food and energy costs and is a good guide for future inflation came in at about percent in june also higher than in may both headline and core inflation have shown no progress in the last si months while core services inflation decreased relative to the end of last year core goods inflation has pushed up inflation recently i see firmer core goods inflation as already partially reflecting the pass through of increased tariffs which has been shown by research done at the fed in addition cpi and ppi reports released in the past two days show that increases in core goods prices were more broad based in the month of june while many forecasters may have been e pecting a sooner and sharper increase in overall inflation there are many reasons to think that larger effects of tariffs are still coming first businesses built up inventories ahead of anticipated tariff increases giving them leeway to still sell goods at pre tariffed prices second given the many changes in implemented tariff policies businesses may not yet be passing the higher tariffs to their selling prices because they are waiting for greater clarity third businesses especially larger ones may also be waiting to capture market share from others that hike prices sooner fourth the current environment of still elevated short run inflation expectations makes it easier for workers to seek higher wages and business to charge higher prices which could increase the persistence of price hikes going forward fifth tariff rates could increase further as seen in newly proposed reciprocal tariffs for several countries and the new tariffs on copper introduced last week putting further upward pressure on prices other unforeseen shocks such as geopolitical ones may further push inflation upward soon board staff research shows that increased geopolitical risk is associated with high inflation in the u s with effects peaking about two years after the geopolitical shock renewed tensions in the middle east together with the possibility of an e tension and escalation of the russian invasion of ukraine are important geopolitical risks to monitor turning to the employment side of our mandate i see a labor market that has been stable and resilient the june employment report showed that employers added a robust jobs boosted by jobs in the state and local government sector private payroll employment increased by showing some moderation relative to previous months additionally the unemployment rate has stayed in a narrow and historically low range for more than a year layoff measures have remained subdued and the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has largely been stable at a level that suggests demand and supply for labor are roughly balanced conclusion considering the near term outlook that i just outlined i see that the u s economy has remained resilient with labor markets appearing to be stable and close to full employment inflation meanwhile remains above the fomc s percent goal and is facing upward pressure from implemented tariffs moreover i judge that inflation is likely to increase further as tariff effects build up during the rest of the year given the stability in the employment side of our mandate with the unemployment rate still at historically low levels elevated short run inflation expectations and goods inflation rising due to the upward pressure from tariffs i find it appropriate to hold our policy rate at the current level for some time this still restrictive policy stance is important to keep longer run inflation expectations anchored moving forward i will make policy decisions based on incoming economic data the evolving outlook and my assessment of risks to both sides of our dual mandate thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today the views e pressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the

at the brookings institution washington d c share watch live thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today i am here to discuss one of the most important resources that policymakers have the lessons of history in discharging my responsibilities at the federal reserve i have been thinking a lot about history its study provides the opportunity to step out of the particular circumstances of today to inform our understanding of the core issues at the heart of financial regulation while we must be attentive to new and even unprecedented challenges e perience shows that understanding the lessons of history gives policymakers a great advantage many of the decisions we face today have in some form been confronted by previous generations of policymakers in these remarks i want to discuss a particular pattern in the history of the financial system which is the relationship between regulatory weakening and the economic and financial cycle of booms and busts my intent is not to re hash well e amined facts or to go over past historical episodes chapter and verse rather i aim to offer a perspective on this historical throughline that focuses on the regulatory cycle it s widely accepted that the economy and financial system e perience cyclical booms and busts booms have historically been characterized by a multitude of good things these can include fast economic growth workers who had been sidelined entering the workforce and improving their lives and financial innovations that often make credit or investments more readily available at the same time some of the characteristics of a boom economy such as rapid increases in credit and in financial market activity as well as greater risk taking and leverage can sow the seeds of busts in busts economic activity and lending contract and asset prices decline this can lead to rapid deleveraging and dislocation throughout the financial system which worsen the downturn causing job losses and business closures homes lost and lives upended there are usually multiple causes that drive booms and make busts so terrible some unique to each individual episode but one factor that is common to many past cycles of boom and bust is weakening financial regulation weakening regulation often drives risk taking and increases bank fragility during the boom making the ensuing bust more painful indeed economic research suggests that weaker regulation leads to more bank failures setting the stage for worse recessions moreover because the financial system evolves so rapidly regulation must also continuously adjust much regulatory weakening occurs simply when regulators fail to keep pace while at other times there is a deliberate action to lower regulatory burden that ends up miscalculating the risk involved let me be clear here that when i refer to regulatory weakening i mean not only direct deregulatory actions by regulators or legislators but also failure of the regulatory framework to keep up with changing circumstances in principle financial regulation should incentivize banks to engage in responsible risk taking and build up resources in good times so that they can deal with times of financial stress and continue their vital role in the economy in bad times the prosperity that accompanies a healthy economy should allow banks to invest in improved risk management and strong financial resources however a healthy economy can also reduce the effectiveness of regulatory constraints on bank risk taking this can occur for a host of reasons including behavioral biases political pressure market dynamics and the tendency for innovation to move more quickly than regulators these dynamics can result in regulatory weakening during boom times when actively pursued this weakening often appears justified at the time and may be implemented by well meaning policymakers who simply miscalculate the long run effects of their actions my purpose in these remarks is to recount several boom and bust episodes in american history and identify some lessons that can guide policymakers entrusted with the responsibility of promoting a strong and stable banking system this history demonstrates the connection between regulatory weakening and cycles of boom and bust i don t mean to suggest that more regulation is always better or that repealing and reforming regulations isn t sometimes appropriate to remove obsolete rules and relieve unnecessary burden but if we can at least agree that regulation should seek to limit devastating financial crises then the history that i will describe today offers some lessons for anyone thinking about regulatory policy there are of course lots of e amples to choose from both in the united states and abroad but i ll focus on the great depression the savings and loan s l crisis and the global financial crisis i will then discuss some possible reasons that similar episodes could recur and conclude with some thoughts on the lessons we can learn the great depression let s start with the biggest and most widely studied bust in u s history the great depression scholars continue to debate its causes which were multiple and comple one compelling argument focuses on the failure of regulation to keep pace with the innovations of the roaring twenties as i said i view such regulatory stagnation as a form of weakening this weakened regulatory environment played a role in setting the stage for and then e acerbating the bust weakened regulation that had failed to keep up with the times left banks unable to weather shocks to the economy the banking sector s collapse was a significant factor in making the great depression the most severe economic crisis that this country has ever e perienced the roaring twenties e pansion was powered by the post war recovery and technological advances in transportation manufacturing and communications stock markets grew quickly to help finance this innovation while residential and commercial real estate investment surged and swelling demand for consumer durables led in turn to increased demand for financing as credit needs escalated there was intensifying competition among banks savings and loan institutions s ls and rapidly growing nonbank finance companies trust companies and other financial vehicles the s were also characterized by high levels of financial speculation both inside and outside the banking sector banks engaged in speculation through nonbank affiliates and supported speculation by lending at the same time many banks were relatively thinly capitalized and overly concentrated especially given the lack of federal deposit insurance at the time in addition many states had prohibitions on branching that prevented banks from diversifying their portfolios and inhibited local competition keeping many struggling banks alive the stock market boomed margin lending grew dramatically and insider trading and market manipulation were rampant as the financialization of the economy increased the regulatory framework failed to keep up outdated branching restrictions remained failing to reflect the size and dynamism of the modern economy banks gained permission to engage in new activities such as real estate lending and certain activities in the securities markets however capital requirements and other rules were not adjusted to reflect potential increased risks from these new activities the cumulative effect of these events was a significantly weakened regulatory environment and a substantial buildup in risk without a commensurate increase in resources to allow the sector to withstand the risks posed looking back we know that when the economic shock hit the banking system magnified that shock the boom of the roaring twenties started to go bust in when the fast growth of the past decade turned to contraction followed by a series of financial and banking crises in all appro imately of the nation s banks failed resulting in major losses to depositors given the lack of federal deposit insurance and a significant contraction in credit that deepened and lengthened the economic downturn notably banks in states that had more robust regulatory frameworksâ for e ample those that applied higher capital requirementsâ had lower rates of failure in response to the financial collapse in the great depression congress adopted reforms aimed at addressing risks that had driven those panics among these steps congress established the federal deposit insurance corporation and federal deposit insurance to reduce the risk of bank runs and protect retail depositors congress increased regulatory oversight of banks and separated commercial and investment banking congress also enacted strong securities laws and created the securities and e change commission sec overall these steps helped stabilize the financial sector and ushered in a long period of quiescence in banking the savings loan crisis my second e ample today is the s l crisis of the s and early s which did substantial harm to millions of americans and the financial system and was e tremely e pensive to resolve in this episode in contrast to the great depression affirmative deregulation led to e cessive risk taking by s ls as well as banks during a boom period as circumstances soured revealing weaknesses congress attempted to bolster the s l sector by loosening the regulatory framework further this failed to resolve the underlying stress and instead further fueled the buildup in risk taking worsening the losses in the subsequent bust let me first set the stage the years leading up to the s l crisis were characterized by dramatic growth in business credit in the course of the economic e pansion that began in at the beginning of this period the s l sector primarily served the residential real estate market because of restrictions on s l activities these restrictions eased over the s allowing s ls to get significantly larger and engage in new kinds of lending however these changes were not accompanied by sufficient regulatory enhancements to account for increased risks this e pansion in s l activity also presented new competition with commercial banks which had themselves built up significant risks as they e panded into new activities at the same time both s ls and banks were increasingly under pressure due to both high inflation and high interest rates which disrupted their funding models competition for customer funds increased dramatically especially because of the rise of money market mutual funds which had grown rapidly when congress removed outdated deposit rate caps to allow banks and s ls to more effectively compete for funds it did so without implementing adequate safeguards against these institutions taking on e cessive risk this led many s ls to engage in increasingly risky projects to compensate for escalating funding costs banks also increased their deposit rates and took on more risk as vulnerabilities at s ls became evident congress federal regulators and the states attempted to bolster both sectors with the hope of allowing them to outgrow those weaknesses for instance congress and the states reduced restrictions on s ls ability to invest in commercial and consumer loans these changes contributed to the boom in commercial real estate lending which became a key source of vulnerability in addition congress and the federal home loan bank board the federal s l regulator at the time weakened capital requirements and the enforcement of those requirements for the s l sector this allowed institutions to become weaker and poorly capitalized entities to stay afloat leaving s ls as a whole badly positioned to weather adverse conditions the bust when it came was severe s l losses continued to mount throughout the s many banks also e perienced severe stress these difficulties were amplified by an eventual decline in real estate values and problems in the agricultural and energy sectors in there were just under s ls by that number had fallen to below with over of the remaining institutions insolvent as judged by book value and over banks failed between and regulatory weakening had propped up tottering institutions allowing zombie institutions to persist accumulating much greater losses than they otherwise would have the process of cleaning up the sector began in earnest in the late s and continued into the mid s with a final cost of billion roughly percent of gross domestic product at the time and the cost of resolving insured banks that failed during this period was billion congress implemented significant reforms in response to the s l crisis including stricter capital and accounting requirements limits on insured depository institutions investment powers and e pansions of regulators enforcement authority these changes paved the way for stability in the banking sector for some time the global financial crisis i ll turn now to my final e ample the global financial crisis which had devastating effects for the millions of people who lost their livelihoods their homes and their businesses in the decade leading up to the crisis america e perienced rapid credit growth and a housing boom there was optimism about the benefits of financial innovation such as securitization of home loans and belief in the power of market discipline as a form of self regulation home prices and mortgage debt accelerated in tandem driven by a mutually reinforcing cycle of optimism with home prices roughly doubling between and and even larger increases in mortgage debt amid this boom lending standards dropped driven by investor demand for mortgage backed securities which were increasingly opaque and risky in their design but still highly rated by the rating agencies there was substantial growth in the over the counter otc derivatives market including new forms of credit derivatives money market funds boomed becoming increasingly linked to the off balance sheet business of banks these developments led to the emergence of large short funded and interconnected financial entitiesâ both banks and nonbanks the regulatory environment failed to keep up with these changes in activity and the increasing comple ity of financial institutions and markets and regulatory weakening heightened vulnerabilities the gramm leach bliley act enacted in permitted the creation of financial holding companies that could engage in the full range of financial activities however the act did not put in place a regulatory framework commensurate with the full range of financial risks and permitted nonbank firms such as investment banks and insurance conglomerates to compete with banks wholly outside its framework the commodity futures modernization act of e empted otc derivatives transactions from virtually all regulation and oversight by the commodity futures trading commission and sec in the lead up to the crisis regulators cut oversight further a striking image from the time featured the head of one financial regulatory agency wielding a chainsaw to demonstrate his commitment to slashing regulations the competitive landscape and regulatory lacuna led to a race to the bottom in standards for underwriting and issuing mortgage loans and securities and transactions became increasingly funded by opaque and unstable short term wholesale funding consumers were left unprotected as the subprime crisis grew in addition the largest investment banks which were overseen by the sec increased their leverage with heavy reliance on short term funding leaving them increasingly vulnerable to any losses these are just a few e amples of the widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision that occurred in both the banking and nonbanking sectors in the lead up to the crisis the resulting recession and financial crisis saw the deepest and longest contraction in economic activity since the second world war the collapse of large financial institutions significant government support to keep the financial system afloat and a prolonged period of slow growth in response to this crisis congress passed the dodd frank act a reform package that among other things strengthened bank capital addressed off balance sheet e posures and provided for stress testing consumer protections were strengthened and a new consumer financial protection bureau was established supervisors ramped up forward looking supervision in addition banking regulators adopted capital and liquidity reforms which substantially improved the resiliency of the banking sector studying the role that regulatory weakening played in the crisis provides a powerful reminder of the importance of preserving these regulatory gains lessons for policymakers reviewing these three e amples together it is striking to see the pattern of regulatory weakening during a boom including the failure of the regulatory environment to keep pace with the evolving financial sector and how this weakening lays the foundation for a subsequent bust why do we continue to see these cycles some reasons are psychological others political humans have short memories especially for e periences we might like to forget the further we get from a crisis the more its causes fade from memory and the less likely a recurrence seems we become more likely to view regulations as unduly burdensome and place less value on the protection they offer from downside risk the financial sector itself lobbies hard to weaken regulation which is often effective when the last crisis seems far away credit cycles financial innovation and the evolving needs of the economy are also significant contributors as the economy changes so do financing needs this makes it harder to recognize when things are running too hot in addition regulators are understandably cautious about restraining innovations that have societal benefits which may hinder their ability to reduce associated risks longstanding regulations can be subject to regulatory arbitrage making them less effective as activities migrate outside the regulated system these dynamics make the financial sector unstable feeding the boom and bust cycle how can we do better the first lesson is to approach the financial system with a through the cycle perspective and avoid thinking this time is different in each of the booms i have covered there was a heady confidence that market discipline would control risk taking that downside risks were so implausible as not to merit attention and that easing regulation was justified with such confidence insufficient thought was given to how regulatory weakening might create new vulnerabilities a bit of humility would have helped while it is true that regulation must evolve with the economy and financial system we need to recognize that rela ing rules can create vulnerabilities changes in the markets themselves can also weaken the effectiveness of regulations the second lesson is that policymakers should resist the pressure to loosen regulations or to refrain from imposing regulation on new activities during the boom times with past economic downturns in the rearview mirror regulations start to be seen as a limitation on growth rather than necessary protection against vulnerabilities as became evident in past episodes vigilant supervision and prudent rules on risk taking are important to prevent future crises while there is a tradeoff it is important to have appropriate protections in place to reduce the risks and costs of the resulting busts third regulation cannot be static if regulation fails to keep up with evolution of the financial sector it can create new risks or hinder growth to conclude an important lesson we can draw from u s financial crises is the role that ill advised weakening of the bank regulatory framework played in those crises it is well within our ability and is our duty as regulators to learn from these episodes to avoid making the same mistakes in doing so we can help to ensure that the financial system is prepared to weather downturns and continue to serve households

reconstruction and refugee return to begin reducing the odds of a future e tremist takeover the united states cannot be sure that russia would agree to such a deal but moscow has incentives to end this war too this piece originally appeared in the national interest as the white house prepares for the july summit between american president trump and russian president putin syria will be on the agenda president trump has signaled his interest in winding down the u s military presence in that country s long and tragic civil war in e change according to press reports president trump may ask putin to contain iran s influence in syria a huge lift given the scale of iran s presence in the country and the critical role it has played in the assad regime s military gains since with such a promise by putin together with further progress in the fight against isis in the country s east mr trump might then declare mission accomplished and pull the united states out of syria entirely this would be a major mistake for several reasons first russia has broken too many of its commitments in syria to take putin s guarantees seriously for e ample russia has been bombing opposition positions in southwest syria in recent days even though it signed a de escalation agreement with america and jordan promising not to do so last year second the degree of russian leverage over iran or even over the assad regime is questionable in the past iran and the regime have brushed aside russian efforts to reshape the political and diplomatic landscape in syria most notably in dismissing putin s recent statement that all foreign forces must leave the country third if the united states abandons any role in syria it will undermine just about the only remaining source of leverage the u s has to shape the trajectory of the syrian conflict in the midst of yet another barbarous regime offensive in southwest syria which is displacing additional tens of thousands of innocent civilians turning america s back and ceding the field entirely to president bashar al assad would be a moral outrage it would also sow the seeds for the resurgence of isis just as shia abuse of sunnis in iraq under prime minister nouri al maliki gave rise to isis al qaeda in that country in american officials may hope that the u n sponsored diplomatic process in geneva could rescue the situation by negotiating an end to the assad regime and a new national unity government but that story is a fairy tale assad who holds most of the military cards in syria now has no interest in being negotiated out of power especially in favor of a majoritarian government that would inevitably be sunni dominated and thus quite possibly seek vengeance against assad and his fellow alawites fourth actions that signal that the u s is no longer concerned with the outcome of the conflict will make it far more difficult for washington to help israel jordan turkey and lebanon with the war s ultimate fallout and with the return or relocation of refugees additionally it will make it much harder for the u s to influence the shape of any future regional security architecture and temper the influence of hostile actors in the middle east admittedly seven and a half years into this tragic conflict there are no good answers however some outcomes are much less bad than others for instance it is still realistic for the united states to help protect its kurdish partners in the country s northeast furthermore america can secure some limited protections and temporary autonomy for friendly opposition forces and the populations they represent elsewhere moreover it is important to begin reconstruction and the return of refugees in parts of syria outside of the regime s control it is also possible to work with other countries to try to pressure assad out of office over time in favor of a somewhat more tolerable successor these steps will also reduce the odds of an isis emerging will limit though hardly end iran s influence in the country and hold out at least some prospect of addressing the larger strategic effects of the regime s victory the core elements of a strategy that would seek to achieve the above objectives without significantly e panding the role of american military forces in the syria conflict should include the following first recognize that the geneva process will not replace assad with an elected government or a truly representative government of national unity instead adopt the longer term goal that assad will choose his own successor subject to approval by the international community with a cabinet of advisors and ministers that would include individuals from the country s other major regions and sectarian groups assad remains unlikely to accept such a compromise but it may be the best america can hope for and it is consistent with statements from russian and iranian leaders about the need for post conflict reforms in syria s government in the short term use negotiations with damascus and moscow to pursue protections for various autonomous zones in opposition dominated regions within syria this could start with the country s kurdish northeast which should be split into at least two such zones to mitigate turkish worries about kurdish secessionism similar autonomous areas should be pursued for areas mainly in opposition hands notably in the country s northwest near idlib if possible american and international assistance should then start flowing to these zones however e cept for very limited humanitarian aid such assistance should not be given to the central government or any regions assad still rules until he steps down in the manner indicated above american forces should stay on the ground in roughly their current numbers to help with reconstruction and to ensure the autonomous areas remain secure until assad is gone in addition u s funding for stabilization programming in opposition controlled areas should be restored immediately american and allied airpower should remain available if need be to retaliate against any regime or iranian attacks on american or friendly positions the united states cannot be sure that russia would agree to such a deal if it did america cannot be confident it has the political capital to assist in carrying it out but russia does have incentives to end this war too this type of pragmatic plan for syria would protect america s friends and allies while allowing reconstruction and refugee return to begin reducing the odds of a future e tremist takeover and it is certainly better than trusting russia to evict iran from syria or trusting assad to show mercy to his own people the emergence of an isis or similar e tremist movement could easily be the result of an abrupt american departure and

streamline icon bluesky print in an otherwise e cellent column on november the two immediate tests for trump s foreign policy jackson diehl strongly critiques mr trump s initial thinking towards the syrian war specifically he states that u s alignment with russia will quickly alienate america s sunni allies such as saudi arabia and jordan which see the syrian civil war as a pro y fight with iran just back from a trip to amman during which i met with a number of high ranking government officials i am confident that this is in fact not the case at least not in jordan burdened by million syrian refugees or almost percent of the nation s own population jordan has an acute interest in seeing the civil war in syria end but it has deduced after five years of watching the obama administration seek to simultaneously defeat isis while pressuring president assad out of power there that it is important to have priorities the u s approach has not worked even if it has gradually weakened isis it has done nothing to weaken the al qaida derivative in syria commonly called al nusra now renamed the conquest of syria front to mask those roots nor has it reduced the intensity of the civil war indeed without declaring this to be government policy one official said to me that there is a growing sense in the region that perhaps one is better off with the devil one knows meaning assad rather than a successor regime that could include jihadi elements or the absence of any meaningful central government most of all many e press a willingness to consider new strategies and approaches at a time when the old way has clearly failed on november the post ran an e cellent news story e plaining that president obama has recently authorized greater use of intelligence assets to gain information about the conquest of syria front so that the group can be attacked more effectively until just recently the united states tolerated the front which is often intermi ed on the battlefield with more moderate insurgent fighters recognizing how little pressure was otherwise being placed on the brutal syrian dictator the united states had been reluctant to go after the front even after agreeing last summer with russia that we should in fact collectively take it on in this conte t trump s apparent willingness to attack both isis and the front actually foreshadowed a decision that obama was just about to make himself none of this is to e press admiration for mr trump s foreign policy thinking which in general i find underdeveloped at best dangerous at worst however in regard to syria in particular there may be opportunities to work together with both russia and regional states and this is probably necessary as another jordanian official told me any solution likely requires cooperation with russia what both trump and russia and key regional actors need to appreciate is that assad himself cannot of course be the answer of course it is not quite that simple what both trump and russia and key regional actors need to appreciate is that assad himself cannot of course be the answer he may be the devil we know but he is in fact a devil having killed most of the or more who have died in this conflict and driven millions from their homes assad simply has too much blood on his hands to be a stabilizing and legitimate ruler of all of syria ever again he is despised by large segments of the sunni muslim majority in syria who have seen their neighborhoods shelled and barrel bombed and their populations deprived of food and medical care for more than half a decade in this terrible war we might temporarily defeat isis only to see another wave of salafist jihadism follow and the war would go on so what kinds of longer term strategies are available to us persuading assad to step down in favor of a new power sharing government might be the theoretically most appealing approach it has been u s policy for more than half a decade however it has gone nowhere perhaps things will change but especially after the russian intervention in the war last year and resulting changes in battlefield momentum assad shows no interest in leaving office that leaves some type of territorial compromise as the most logical goal if there will not be power sharing within a strong central government there can be power sharing regionally such devolution of governance can take various forms there could be one or two autonomous zones in some parts of the country as with kurdistan in iraq with assad still in power in damascus or there could be a new relatively weak national government stitching together a federation or confederation of largely self governing entities as in bosnia there might even be a swiss style cantonment system whichever solution is ultimately negotiated by syrians with outside support assad s future role would have to be limited to truly governing only those parts of syria where alawites and christians are in the majority my own view is that a formal confederation is the most militarily achievable and politically sustainable in the end syrians can and must do the choosing of course but we owe them an open mind and options for five years the international community has been assuming that only a strong central state with a new government can be the outcome of this conflict and negotiation process that approach has been unduly restrictive and it has failed miserably related books the future of isis terrorism e tremism the future of isis feisal al istrabadi sumit ganguly june inheriting syria international affairs inheriting

clever diplomacy and a willingness to attack both isis and the conquest front the united states should still support moderate opposition fighters in this conflict they have done too much including to

will not agree even to a system of autonomy or of confederation we need both more diplomatic fle ibility and more military leverage so mr trump is not wrong but his view to date is incomplete because collaboration with putin cannot be the whole answer to solving our combined problems in syria and assad as the future president of the whole country certainly cannot be the answer either a broader vision for what the future syrian state can consist of with more options is needed soon if mr trump can embed his ideas for collaborating with russia against isis and the conquest of syria front within a broader strategy that aspires to the creation of a new type of syria in which all groups have rights and safety in the future his instincts might just help it is too soon just to dismiss it

it sends a strong message to president bashar assad that chemical weapons will not be tolerated and to russia that the united states is not afraid to act it also signals to the world that president trump is capable of using american military power assertively yet responsibly but there is no obvious military step that could follow russians are present at some other air bases in syria making it hard to strike those facilities in any event hitting fi ed sites from standoff range never threatened saddam hussein s rule in iraq during the clinton administration and now is unlikely to threaten assad s no broader strategy is yet in place to do what is truly needed in syria defeating both isis and al qaeda while gradually ending the civil war we need to think hard about what comes next the trump administration has oscillated in recent days between saying on the one hand that assad has a fairly firm grip on power and on the other that as secretary of state re tillerson just declared it is hard to see assad being part of the long term picture in syria both sentiments are understandable the first is a realpolitik assessment of where things stand in syria militarily the second is the correct moral judgment and more than that it reflects the fact that sunnis and kurds in syria cannot really be e pected to live under such a brutal leader any longer what is needed is a political strategy for syria that squares this circle assad must go yet he will likely stay that is a parado that requires creative thinking it also requires compromise since no one favors a u s led iraq like invasion to displace him definitively and since the geneva process created during the obama years to negotiate a new government in syria never really had a chance two changes in our strategy are needed first we need more friendly military power on the ground in syria both to liberate cities held by isis and to make assad feel the heat so he will negotiate second we need a short term way to protect sunni and kurdish syrians in autonomous zones that would be governed and protected separately even if assad remains nominally in charge his removal can be achieved more slowly and gradually as long as those whose people have been massacred can get out from under his rule in the meantime to create more combat power among friendly forces on the ground we will need to work more intensively with kurdish and moderate sunni groups president obama was moving in this direction albeit much too slowly but he then ran up against a turkish roadblock turkey did not want us to arm the syrian kurds lest they transfer weapons to turkish kurds who might use them in terrorist attacks in istanbul ankara or other parts of anatolia there are several ways to address these turkish fears don t give weapons to the kurds loan them with future economic aid to the kurds contingent on their eventual return commit now to have american forces on the ground near the turkish syrian border as part of a future peacekeeping force and finally require at least two separate autonomous zones for kurds rather than a singlezone turkish forces could remain in place to keep them separate preventing their pursuit of an independent syrian kurdistan we also need to figure out how any autonomous zones would be assisted and protected more generally and how assad and russian president vladimir putin would be persuaded to accept them the recent strikes actually can help by reestablishing american military credibility we should also make clear that foreign donors the united states the europeans the japanese and koreans the gulf states will help rebuild the parts of syria that assad controls only when he allows the creation of these autonomous zones and establishes a process to step down from power that process could take a while in the interim we could allow humanitarian aid but not large scale development assistance to flow to areas still controlled by assad russia and iran and hezbollah

assad regime syrians now have the opportunity to build the future for which so many fought died and suffered over the past years whether they will be able to do so is uncertain early indicators offer some basis for optimism yet if syria s still nascent transition is to succeed a new government will need to move urgently to repair syria s devastated economy today most syrians live in desperate economic conditions the united nations reports that more than of syrians live in poverty while the cost of living has tripled in the past three years by when violence began to ebb a third of the country s housing stock had been destroyed along with half of its medical and educational facilities and its power grid in most of the country electricity is available for only a few hours each day for the new government to be seen as legitimate and worthy of support syrians will need to feel their economic conditions improving they will need to see that an economic recovery is being managed not only efficiently but fairly commenting just days after bashar al assad fled to moscow his former prime minister mohammed ghazi jalali observed that poverty and corruption led to the fall of the syrian regime not the year war in the country years of economic crisis and predatory rule by the assad regime drained it of support and left it vulnerable to collapse to avoid a renewed eruption of economic grievances that could easily destabilize a precarious transition the interim government will need to persuade syrians that they are better off and have better prospects than they did under assad since the regime s fall discussions about how to assist syria s economic recovery have focused on sanctions relief selectively lifting sanctions on critical economic sectors and institutions such as the oil sector and the syrian central bank should happen quickly while sanctions on assad regime figures complicit in war crimes remain in place unfortunately quick action by either the united states the european union or european governments is unlikely all three are using sanctions as leverage to nudge the new syrian administration toward an inclusive political transition that respects human rights following the first meeting between the french and german foreign ministers and their syrian counterparts in damascus germany s foreign minister annalena baerbock underscored the european position telling reporters that europe will not be a financier of islamist structures the biden administration also shows little interest in quick action on sanctions beyond the biden administration s risk aversion sanctions relief faces steep legal and bureaucratic hurdles most u s sanctions including those intended to deter third party trade and investment are mandated by law these include provisions of the caesar syria civilian protection act that were renewed on december when president joe biden signed the national defense authorization act ndaa congress passed the ndaa on december only days after the assad regime collapsed leaving too little time for caesar provisions to be stripped from the bill to rescind provisions of the caesar act or lift other sanctions passed by congress over the past four decades will require quick bipartisan action and the support of the incoming trump administration in the interim the biden administration has issued a general license that lifts some restrictions on trade and financial flows for si months this is a welcome step it will bring a measure of economic relief yet the license preserves sanctions on activities essential for reconstruction including sweeping restrictions on new investment and with sanctions still in place a temporary general license may not be sufficient to overcome the legal concerns of banks and firms whose willingness to do business in syria is critical for long term recovery the initial focus of the new republican controlled congress will be on its domestic priorities yet congressional action to rescind the caesar act should not be a heavy lift in february the house passed a related bill the assad regime anti normalization act with a huge bipartisan majority of votes if the trump administration supports legislative action to remove a major impediment to syria s economic recovery congress could readily act on a bill that would bolster prospects of a stable sustainable and legitimate transition in syria to remove sanctions in the face of serious concerns about how syria s new administration will govern is not without risks yet withholding sanctions relief as a source of leverage may prove far more costly without the economic relief that the removal of sanctions makes possible the prospects for a sustainable legitimate political transition will become even more uncertain with spoilers seizing every opportunity to derail syria s fragile transition deferring economic recovery is a recipe for chaos and discord and while western governments hold back on sanctions relief to assess its responsiveness the administration in damascus is no doubt doing the same keeping its own balance sheet of how its appeals for relief are being received in western capitals after decades of sharp antagonism between the united states and the assad regime there is a fleeting window now in the early phases of transition to put u s syrian relations on a more positive footing with potential long term gains for syrians for regional security and for the united states to reject reasonable requests from syria s interim government for urgently needed relief will not only undermine the prospects for economic recovery sustaining the conditions for mass syrian immiseration but also jeopardize opportunities for an improvement in u s syrian relations that the united states struggled but failed to secure during the assad regime s entire year tenure to grasp this opportunity will require the united states to be forthcoming on sanctions relief the potential

refugees unhcr there are more than million refugees worldwide under its mandate most of them are hosted in the countries of the global south and find themselves in a protracted situation without access to a durable solution such as voluntary return resettlement or local integration as defined by the unhcr ne t week the global refugee forum will meet in geneva for the second time to address this situation and to revitalize global solidarity vis à vis the countries that host them the global refugee forum was established in to monitor the implementation of the global compact on refugees gcr adopted the previous year the forum gathers representatives from governments international organizations nongovernmental organizations and other entities to support the development of long term sustainable solutions to large movements of refugees at the forum stakeholders make voluntary pledges in the form of financial contributions policy changes specific programs or projects and other types of support to improve the conditions of refugees and their host communities the forum also provides an opportunity to explore innovative policy proposals one such proposal has been made by the united nations development program undp under the title of the turkey compact its central idea is that in return for hosting large numbers of refugees and facilitating their access to formal employment the countries of the global north should grant these countries facilitated market access by concluding preferential trade agreements with them this idea deserves greater policy attention because it promises to make long term support for refugees and their host communities considerably more sustainable and effective the global refugee forum provides an ideal platform to do this economic inclusion for refugees an important consequence of the european migration crisis of and was the realization that the refugee protection regime based on the geneva convention relating to the status of refugees was broken and improving the economic inclusion of refugees could benefit both refugees as well as the development of their host communities a growing body of research also shows that the proper employment prospects for refugees and a welcoming environment for their entrepreneurs contribute to economic growth in the host country this research moreover demonstrates that the faster obstacles to formal employment are resolved the sooner refugees integrate as productive members of their host society finally this kind of positive integration also enhances the likelihood of refugees returning to their countries of origin and their ability to help with reconstruction there this thinking is reflected in the gcr s call to support the self reliance of refugees and the resilience of host communities through inter alia the promotion of economic opportunities decent work job creation and entrepreneurship programs for host community members and refugees in countries hosting them four countries colombia jordan turkey and uganda have at least on paper made efforts to facilitate access to work permits for refugees while many more countries legally allow refugees to enter their formal labor markets yet these measures have not always been very successful turkey and the limits of promoting economic inclusion take the case of turkey which hosts million refugees the largest number in the world in legislation was introduced that enables refugees under certain conditions to obtain work permits however very few refugees have been granted work permits an estimated to million refugees including women and children participate in the informal labor market under particularly precarious conditions furthermore in turkey considerable international funding has been channeled into projects to support refugees access to livelihood opportunities emphasizing the acquisition of vocational and language skills however despite an ever growing number of such projects there has been neither a sizeable nor a sustainable increase in formal jobs for refugees according to the turkey rp country chapter the livelihood projects put only about individuals into employment through job placement and job creation activities another source put the number of jobs created through such projects from to at creating demand for refugee labor in jordan one way to overcome the problem of transforming improved employability into sustained employment would be to create demand for refugee labor the gcr suggests e ploring preferential trade arrangements especially for goods and sectors with high refugee participation to spur employment both for refugees and locals thereby helping social cohesion this suggestion is fully in line with trade liberalization policies that call for the reduction of tariffs the e pansion or even full elimination of quotas and the resolution of regulatory obstacles all of which are key drivers of economic growth and employment such economic growth would also help create demand for refugees skills and labor and complement ongoing efforts to increase their employability so far the eu jordan compact is the only e ample of its kind in this compact the eu promised to provide easier market access for the products of jordanian companies employing a minimum number of syrian refugees on the condition that the jordanian government facilitate the acquisition of work permits for the refugees however the compact failed to reach its targets for various reasons such as the lack of companies that fit the criteria met eu e port standards and were active in the product sectors listed in the compact the jordanian government s remaining restrictions on the employment of foreign workers and its delays in issuing work permits of which most were for short lived cash for work programs rather than sustainable jobs further contributed to the compact s failure in particular refugee women have not been able to benefit from these efforts with their employment level remaining especially low in contrast the undp s turkey compact offers an actionable policy proposal on how to remedy these problems the undp s proposal deserves attention last year the undp commissioned a feasibility study that demonstrated how an e tension of trade preferences to turkey by canada the eu and the united states could incentivize businesses in the turkish agricultural processed food and te tile sectors to generate sustainable employment for both syrian refugees and locals if implemented this policy would help e pand turkish e ports by an estimated billion in create directly and indirectly jobs and add of value to turkey s overall gdp like the eu jordan compact the turkey compact conditions western countries trade liberalization on the increased formal employment of syrian refugees in turkish companies this policy proposal is in line with the gcr s call for a whole society approach that also incorporates the interests and needs of host communities while addressing the challenges of social cohesion it would also be in line with the united nations sustainable development goals and its commitment to leave no one behind in the longer run this proposal could constitute a template for other countries particularly in the global south that host many refugees by promoting agreements that take a developmental approach instead of focusing on migration control by means of pure border management finally especially given the political atmosphere vis à vis refugees in eu member states today win win migration agreements that offer host countries tangible benefits in the form of sustainable job creation could become an effective way to uphold the geneva convention of the undp s policy proposal of e tending trade preferences to

ale ander joe afp via getty images en english politics the scramble for critical minerals jul rabah arezki and rick van der ploeg vast natural resource endowments have proven to be more of a curse than a blessing with resource rich countries often developing more slowly than their resource poor counterparts today countries rich in critical minerals have a chance to change this but only if they invest in strengthening their institutional capacity paris the world s superpowers have developed a seemingly insatiable appetite for the critical minerals that are essential to the ongoing energy and digital transitions including rare earth metals for semiconductors cobalt for batteries and uranium for nuclear reactors the international energy agency forecasts that demand for these minerals will more than quadruple by for use in clean energy technologies alone but in their race to control these vital resources china europe and the united states risk causing serious harm to the countries that possess them as it stands china is leading the pack having gained ownership or control over an estimated of the critical minerals that are needed for industry such as for magnets and the green transition this control e tends across the supply chain china is heavily invested in mining across africa central asia and latin america and has been building up its processing capabilities for western powers china s quasi monopoly over critical minerals looks like an economic and national security threat this fear is not unfounded in december china restricted e ports of critical minerals to the us in retaliation for us restrictions on e ports of advanced microchips to china since then us president donald trump has forced ukraine to relinquish a significant share of its critical minerals to the us in what he presents as repayment for american support in its fight against russia trump also wants us sovereignty over mineral rich greenland to the dismay of denmark and he has suggested that canada with all its natural resources become america s st state the european union for its part has sought its own mining contracts such as in the democratic republic of the congo drc touted as the saudi arabia of critical minerals from the scramble for africa in the nineteenth century to western attempts to claim middle eastern oil in the twentieth such resource grabs are hardly new they reflect a fundamental asymmetry less industrialized developing economies tend to consume fewer resources than they produce whereas the opposite is true for developed economies and nowadays china in principle this asymmetry creates ideal conditions for mutually beneficial agreements industrialized economies get the resources they desire and non industrialized economies get a windfall which they can use to bolster their own development but in reality vast natural resource endowments have proven to be more of a curse than a blessing with resource rich countries often developing more slowly

starting at less than per month for your first year click the button below to view our subscription offerings subscribe now a key reason for this is that developed economies have more economic clout advanced technology and military might all of which they bring to bear to acquire the resources they seek for e ample european imperial powers used steam engine technology to help them explore and e ploit africa for resources like copper tin rubber timber diamonds and gold in the nineteenth century this together with more advanced weaponry and other technologies meant that far from offering local communities fair compensation for their valuable resources european powers could subjugate those communities and use their labor to e tract and transport what they wanted but even countries that are e porting their resources for a profit have often struggled to make progress on development not only because of imbalanced deals with more powerful resource importers but also because their governments have often mismanaged the associated bonanzas it does not help that resource rich countries and regions often grapple with internal and e ternal conflicts consider the mineral rich provinces of the drc such as katanga and north kivu which have long suffered from violence and lawlessness fueled by neighbors such as rwanda and uganda today the advance of the rwanda backed m rebels is fueling bloodshed in eastern congo and creating an opportunity for outside powers to gain access to critical minerals the drc rwanda peace agreement brokered by the trump administration promises precisely such access to the us in e change for security guarantees but the resource curse is not inescapable especially for countries with strong outward facing institutions to manage the economy s e ternal relations including its resource sector s ability to attract investment and generate revenues for the state and inward facing institutions to govern how those revenues are used if a country is to translate its resource endowments into economic development and improvements in human well being both have a critical role to play outward facing institutions must negotiate fair and transparent mining contracts with multinational corporations and strengthen local governments ability to do the same such contracts should include local content requirements which keep more high value added processing activities at home increase local employment and strengthen the capacity of local suppliers and contractors since acquiring a stake in de beers botswana has sought to ensure that diamond cutting not just mining occurs domestically which requires inward facing institutions to deliver adequate investment in these capabilities inward facing institutions must also manage risks raised by resource e traction from health and environmental damage deforestation biodiversity loss pollution to labor rights violations including child labor unfortunately as it stands many mineral rich countries are falling far short leading some to advocate boycotts of critical minerals coming from conflict zones or countries using forced labor while such boycotts are unlikely to sway these governments they could convince multinationals and foreign governments to demand better enforcement of environmental and social standards from countries with which they do business ultimately however it is up to mineral rich countries to defend their interests and make the most of their endowments this starts with efforts to strengthen institutions help us strengthen our reporting on global health

th stock getty images en english fr french es spanish sustainability now how to fight climate change without america jul jean pisani ferry beatrice weder di mauro and jeromin zettelmeyer with the us retreating from multilateralism governments must find ways to meet critical climate goals without american involvement the path forward lies in forging mutually beneficial partnerships that align climate objectives with the unique needs of emerging markets and developing economies brussels geneva paris scientists have repeatedly warned us with ever growing intensity that the planet is hurtling toward climate tipping points despite numerous international pledges the evidence suggests that limiting global warming to celsius is increasingly unlikely if current trends persist that threshold could be breached as early as at the same time biodiversity loss is accelerating at an unprecedented rate with dire consequences for vulnerable communities and humanity at large a stable climate and healthy ecosystems are ine tricably linked implying the risk of cascading catastrophes to be sure there has been some progress on both fronts the paris agreement was the most ambitious and politically viable climate deal of its time based on a pledge and review model it set an ambitious yet attainable target and introduced mechanisms to ensure broad participation while establishing a framework for assessing national commitments against the shared goal then in the united nations biodiversity conference cop adopted the kunming montreal global biodiversity framework following a similar approach while some major countries like india remained far behind there was hope that they would eventually join as global momentum continued to build that optimism was short lived on the very first day of his second term us president donald trump signed an e ecutive order titled unleashing american energy and announced that the united states would once again withdraw from the paris agreement dismissing climate change as a hoa governments and civil society now face a fundamental challenge developing viable strategies for achieving climate and biodiversity goals without us involvement hottest sale of the summer subscribe now for less hottest sale of the summer subscribe now for less our summer sale has begun get more access to project syndicate starting at less than per month for your first year click the button below to view our subscription offerings subscribe now in a recent bruegel center for economic policy research report we explore how this can be done we begin with the recognition that while the us remains a major greenhouse gas emitter its policies alone are unlikely to determine the planet s fate the decisive battleground is now in emerging markets and developing economies emdes which account for two thirds of current emissions and are home to most of the world s biodiversity with their emissions rising rapidly emdes must urgently shift to low carbon nature positive growth but they face formidable obstacles massive investment needs high capital costs limited fiscal space and pressing development priorities meaningful climate action will thus require mutually beneficial economic partnerships that align global emissions targets with emdes development needs in our report we identify four types of partnerships that could serve as pillars of a new cooperative framework the first is a carbon pricing alliance underpinned by a shared carbon border adjustment mechanism cbam while regulations and subsidies matter carbon pricing is necessary to incentivize businesses and households to reduce their emissions but without safeguards it risks creating trade distortions by giving a competitive edge to countries that either don t price carbon or set prices far below effective levels that is the rationale for the european union s cbam which applies to only a handful of carbon intensive products like steel and cement during its transitional phase to address this challenge we propose creating a climate coalition of developed and developing countries committed to a tiered carbon price floor based on income level members would benefit from mutual cbam e emptions and gain access to financing technology and markets the eu for e ample could collaborate with any country willing to set a meaningful carbon price including the us should it revise its current stance and china many emdes still depend on emissions intensive coal fired power plants because they require far less capital investment than greener alternatives the second pillar therefore is a climate finance coalition dedicated to decarbonizing the power sector in these countries accelerating this shift will require closing the massive investment gap annual clean energy spending in developing countries must quadruple by to meet the paris agreement s targets compounding the challenge the cost of capital in emdes is often twice as high as in advanced economies making renewables appear artificially e pensive despite falling technology costs we propose formal agreements in which developed economies provide climate financing in e change for emdes commitment to ambitious net zero targets the eu china japan and south korea for e ample could fund emdes decarbonization efforts at an annual cost of less than of their combined gdp a modest investment relative to the climate damage such an agreement would help avert the third pillar is a green industrial partnership between the eu the united kingdom norway and selected countries in the global south given its limited renewable power potential europe will continue to rely on energy imports but rather than shipping green electricity across oceans it would be more efficient to relocate energy intensive production to resource rich emdes european industrial policies currently favor energy intensive sectors and subsidize their decarbonization a smarter approach would be to support downstream high value industries while phasing out protections for uncompetitive upstream production the fourth pillar is the creation of markets for carbon removal and nature protection reaching net zero emissions implies net negative emissions after yet carbon removal whether technological or nature based remains underdeveloped fragmented and poorly incentivized two innovations could help establish these markets one is the introduction of cleanup certificates which would allow emitters to take on carbon debt and repay it in the form of verified future removals financed at scale through market demand another potential solution is the creation of nature shares a new class of financial asset designed to support long term investment in biodiversity rich regions unlike conventional carbon offsets which are often plagued by credibility issues and short termism nature shares would offer a steady stream of carbon and biodiversity dividends priced transparently and backed by robust public governance these tools would enable markets to treat nature not as a liability but as an asset the eu is pivotal to advancing this agenda with its mature carbon market and regulatory credibility the bloc is well positioned to serve as the backbone of emerging international coalitions to that end it must accelerate its own emissions reductions e pand the cbam and forge meaningful industrial partnerships in a

presidency must eschew flashy results in favor of pragmatic pathways to deliver on past agreements cape town in the landmark paris climate agreement set the ambitious but necessary goal of limiting global warming to celsius above pre industrial levels and ensuring that the increase stays well below c with the average global surface temperature having already reached c f above the twentieth century baseline time is running out to reach this goal yet governments have so far failed to agree on a strategy for doing so at last month s nd session of the united nations climate change subsidiary bodies sb in bonn the mid year negotiations intended to lay the groundwork for november s un climate change conference cop in belém countries got so hung up on the details of the agenda that little progress was made such delays have long characterized the un framework convention on climate change but they are at odds with scientific reality which demands rapid and unified action building consensus is thus a key challenge facing brazil s cop presidency the task ahead is formidable not only because of the challenges inherent in the unfccc process but also because four interconnected global developments are undermining trust and impeding multilateral cooperation first the global governance architecture with the un at its core is showing signs of disarray institutions that were designed to nurture and facilitate cooperation are increasingly hamstrung by bureaucratic inertia and outdated organizational structures with reform efforts gridlocked the un system risks losing its relevance and multilateralism its credibility second the rise of transactional diplomacy has meant countries prioritize their own short term interests over collective long term needs this approach based on a narrow conception of national interest effectively precludes broad based cooperation as it erodes the norms that have traditionally underpinned international engagement third compromise is increasingly being rejected in favor of realism leading to e treme polarization and entrenched negotiating positions multilateral negotiations regularly come down to the wire and

fresh agreements and ambitious commitments the kind that grab headlines and make the negotiations look like a smashing success but often fall short when the hard work of implementation begins brazil s cop presidency must eschew flashy results in favor of pragmatic pathways to deliver on past commitments fortunately brazil recognizes this its fourth letter to the international community outlines an action agenda aimed at making progress on what the world has already collectively agreed during previous cops and in the paris climate agreement specifically the agenda seeks to leverage existing initiatives to complete the implementation of the first global stocktake under the paris agreement which was concluded at cop this focus on previously agreed outcomes is well suited to the current geopolitical conte t in which any agreement can be difficult to reach representatives at the sb in bonn did not achieve a consensus and last month s g summit failed to deliver a joint communiqué rather than perpetuating stalemates the action agenda invites stakeholders to make progress where agreement already e ists the agenda also charts the way forward it is organized into si thematic a es including stewarding forests oceans and biodiversity transforming agriculture and food systems and building resilience for cities infrastructure and water unleashing enablers and accelerators in finance technology and capacity building the final cross cutting a is will accelerate implementation at scale since responsibility for the implementation and governance of climate policy is distributed among many actors which must have some level of trust that others are doing their part the agenda also establishes transparency monitoring and accountability as top priorities to this end

direction and a trusted platform for aligning government and investor interests one key to the center s success was early engagement with chambers of commerce another was the reform of the build operate transfer bot law which allowed unsolicited proposals to be considered provided they underwent a competitive challenge so instead of the government prescribing a specific solution the private sector proposed approaches that were aligned with national priorities and delivered the best value for money the resulting partnerships allowed the government to optimize service delivery taking advantage of private sector efficiencies and innovation on one hand and the government s administrative capacity on the other the result was billion in financing mobilized over a decade and the rapid

well suited to advance certain priorities such as social service delivery or some aspects of climate adaptation especially in less developed economies or post conflict and post disaster settings in these cases the public sector must be able to deliver this brings us to the second imperative clear and granular delegation of ownership for agenda implementation after hurricane maria devastated the small island state of dominica in the government passed the climate resilience act and established the climate resilience e ecution agency for dominica cread backed by just million in donor funding for its initial four year mandate the agency was up and running within three months with highly e perienced motivated and mostly local or regional staff in place despite this promising start however cread failed to live up to its potential in the first two years of its mandate and insufficient ownership is a key reason why officially cread was mandated to lead the development and delivery of an ambitious home grown resilience agenda but in practice it was not given the full authority it needed to do so perhaps the agency s legal remit was considered too e pansive or maybe its fast paced operating style was too much of a departure from the civil service norm whatever the reason cread was essentially relegated to the role of adviser even on projects where its in house procurement or construction e pertise could have been a game changer moreover cread had little choice but to support initiatives that had previously been approved by development partners with predetermined scopes of work and implementation modalities so while the agency did leave some positive legacies it is credited with developing dominica s climate resilience and recovery plan and building ministerial capacity it was unable to complete the job for which it was created causing its initial leadership team to resign the broader lesson from both the philippines and dominica is that alignment of e ternal partners alone cannot deliver transformative change if country platforms are to meet their potential they must be truly nationally defined mission driven whole of government led mechanisms and governments must be prepared to operate in new and possibly unconventional ways success depends on intention ownership and capacity but even more so on incentives which constitute the third imperative for governments e ternal incentives like those used in the highly indebted poor countries initiative or the e tractive industries transparency initiative can help to drive progress so can internal mechanisms such as performance based contracts for state owned enterprises development partners for their part must understand that their role is to support governments in achieving their priorities not to elevate priorities of their own and they need incentives to act accordingly at all levels for e ample technical assistance or grants from mdbs and donors should be directed to support project pipeline development and the establishment of locally led implementation frameworks that will remain in place for the long term there must also be incentives for mdbs to collaborate rather than compete with one another country platforms stand a greater chance of gaining traction if they are tied to macroeconomic planning tools such as medium term spending frameworks and the imf world bank debt sustainability analyses and other strategic financing instruments such as debt for development swaps the fourth imperative this would enable finance ministries to establish the platforms value from a broader macro fiscal perspective credibly demonstrating the benefits of increased concessional financing for growth and resilience initiatives and by e tension credit rating improvements while there is no silver bullet for development country platforms can help advance comple investment agendas particularly where institutional gaps in delivery or coordination are hampering progress not least by identifying and backing the most effective projects but good intentions and elegant frameworks will not produce these outcomes without strong public leadership conte t specific delivery

coming name a swath of private neocloud companies such as lambda and crusoe are attracting venture capital funding and working on high profile ai contracts nvidia has taken an interest in these ai native cloud startups as well the chipmaking giant has increased its investments in coreweave and neocloud startups while also developing its own cloud business amid increasing hyperscaler competition but while analysts like the niche neocloud model and their market share potential in the scaling ai cloud market worries about their longer term outlook are beginning to crop up risks they see are in these companies high levels of cape spending lack of differentiation and overall lofty ai valuations ubs global wealth management strategist sundeep gantori views neoclouds as a high risk potentially high reward investment last year neoclouds were very small but now it s something that you cannot ignore in terms of size obviously the revenues from those companies are not on par with the capital spending that they re doing gantori told cnbc the problem however is these companies are spending so much on cape that it hurts their margins he said they re spending much more but it s probably an investment into the future gantori added ubs e pects ai cape beyond the big four tech giants amazon microsoft meta platforms and alphabet to grow year over year and hit billion in that latter estimate includes robust spending from china neoclouds and other hyperscalers and enterprise and sovereign cloud providers looking at overall market opportunity goldman sachs takes a longer point of view on the technology the firm estimates the total addressable market of the gpu as a service and ai cloud market by will be roughly billion with neoclouds comprising share and hyperscalers close ties between nvidia and neoclouds appear risky nvidia has strategically backed neoclouds coreweave lambda crusoe energy and nebius a move that has popularized the space while boosting the chipmaker s own business amid increasing hyperscaler competition some analysts question the ultimate cost of this relationship nvidia has helped the rapid growth of several new gpu focused clouds by directly investing in them providing them large allocations of gpus and publicity by various means hsbc analyst abhishek shukla said in a thursday note having a large number of gpu focused cloud providers improves the competitive position of nvidia as the margin that the cloud providers can charge declines and a bigger share of the value is captured by nvidia and the end customer shukla is concerned about a couple of key financial risks neoclouds face namely that they already generate low returns from their investments and could see declining pricing power as more gpus become available more importantly he believes neoclouds could lose their business if hyperscaler customers eventually source gpus directly from nvidia for e ample shukla said that coreweave may only see business from microsoft as long as there is a shortage of gpus and as long as nvidia favors coreweave while it allocates new gpus once this phase is over microsoft could purchase gpus directly from nvidia we see significant risk of key customers microsoft and open ai disintermediating coreweave and dealing directly with nvidia he said we assess that more than of debt financing available to coreweave is offered by oems includes nvidia in our opinion nvidia benefits from this arrangement only if coreweave is leasing its gpus to customers and creating more competition in the gpu leasing market which helps nvidia shukla said neoclouds remain a substantial part of nvidia s longer term growth opportunity according to some analysts nvidia powering neoclouds along with its own dg platform for ai development allows the company to generate revenue from large scale ai inference workloads and not just its gpus nvda has shifted its strategic posture with regard to neoclouds materially the last nine months and that they now view them as their de facto data center arm loop capital analyst ananda baruah wrote in a recent note adding that nvda s invigorated neocloud strategy is dovetailing into an inferencing strategy wall street views on top neoclouds cloud infrastructure companies coreweave and nebius are the key neocloud players in the market right now europe based nebius appears to be the better liked play of the two the company has four buy ratings from wall street analysts covering the name according to lseg and was recently brought into the limelight by a bullish rating from goldman sachs analyst ale ander duval duval initiated coverage of nebius with a buy rating and month price target of which implies upside our rating reflects our more positive than consensus view on the growth of the ai neocloud market as the generative ai market continues to e pand rapidly and ai startups enterprises seek specialized capacity alongside that provided by hyperscalers duval said in a july note to clients duval said nebius stands to benefit from capital allocation from future funding rounds more customers and capacity e pansion driving revenue and asset utilization as well as deals with large ai labs and companies improving gpu utilization we see nebius as especially well positioned in light of its full stack software offering cost advantages and demonstrable e pertise at scale he said coreweave is the largest publicly traded neocloud by market cap meanwhile with a valuation of more than billion interest in coreweave is still high but the ai stock s frothy valuation has garnered speculation on how far the stock can really go shares have skyrocketed more than since the company s public market debut in the spring however the stock has tumbled in the past month coreweave s recent slide came after the company announced plans to acquire data center infrastructure company and longtime partner core scientific in an all stock transition worth roughly billion the deal could serve as a major test to how wall street views parts of the ai glitz and glamour worries about the transaction being in stock and about coreweave s sky high valuation have been a drag on both stocks on top of that the consensus price target of implies shares could decline nearly lseg data shows crwv y mountain coreweave stock performance over the past year hsbc s shukla initiated the stock with a reduce rating and price target saying coreweave shares are significantly overvalued shukla noted that coreweave s revenue comes primarily from microsoft and open ai who use their own software which he said dilutes crwv s value proposition coreweave s liquidity looks stretched and moreover the company faces a high cost of borrowing he added compared with the likes of microsoft ai model providers have lower liquidity and weaker credit profiles which creates its own set of challenges shukla wrote in a note to clients coreweave s main business of leasing gpus is getting commoditized and offers inferior returns mizuho securities and stifel each downgraded coreweave to hold earlier this month while citigroup on july placed a downside catalyst watch on the stock cfra analyst angelo zino who in early june initiated coreweave with a hold rating and month target price of shares concerns about the stock s valuation however zino anticipates upside to coreweave s bookings as the company s customer base broadens and inference demand grows he likes coreweave s revenue backlog which he said offers multi year visibility and estimates coreweave will boast an operating profit in we re very positive in terms of the near term outlook on a stock but we just think that there are better more affordable ways from a valuation perspective to play the overarching theme of compute zino told cnbc some neoclouds look good for now but there are definitely storm clouds that you could potentially see in the future the neocloud universe includes a slew of private ai infrastructure startups including lambda covalent and crusoe energy crusoe which uses flare gas to build data centers was tapped by oracle in march to build a data center campus in te as for open ai s billion stargate project with buildings e pected to eventually include nvidia blackwell gpus across the campus crusoe pivoted its business to ai from crypto as coreweave did lambda which provides

of the year as the owner of car brands including jeep and fiat grapples with restructuring costs and the impact of us president donald trump s tariffs the company which reported a bn profit for the same period a year earlier said it would take a mn hit from the impact of trump s tariffs including the costs of lost production its shipments in north america during the second quarter fell per cent from a year earlier it also reported bn in pre ta charges including restructuring costs as it looks to revive its fortunes under a new management team led by north america boss antonio filosa the large charges stemmed from the cancellation of programmes such as its recent e it from development of hydrogen vehicles as well as changes in us emissions regulations it also included an e pected charge of mn mainly as a result of impairments on its maserati vehicle platform certainly the management team is not happy with where we re at and we re going to continue to progress in the second half stellantis chief financial officer doug ostermann said in a briefing to investors on monday stellantis is navigating a period of upheaval after the sudden departure of chief e ecutive carlos tavares in december following a sharp deterioration in financial performance the world s fourth largest carmaker has faced rising inventory in the us political tensions in its historic bases of italy and france and weak vehicle demand in europe stellantis is not alone in reporting deteriorating results in recent weeks french carmaker renault this month issued a profit warning due to weak demand in europe while volvo cars also reported its first operating loss since its listing as it warned of smaller profits from two critical vehicle models as a result of trump s car tariffs filosa who was appointed chief e ecutive in may is looking to continue with a turnaround effort started under the interim leadership of chair john elkann who remains as chair stellantis was one of several carmakers to pull its guidance earlier this year due to trade uncertainty caused by the tariffs as trump announced a per cent levy on foreign made vehicles and parts in march and then proposed reciprocal tariffs on almost all trade the group has been grappling with sluggish demand in europe s van business my own view and i think what we hear from clients is that there s a lot of uncertainty in the environment today both economic uncertainty and a lot of regulatory uncertainty ostermann said that has caused commercial customers to hang on to their fleets for a longer period he added stellantis on monday said it had released preliminary financial figures ahead of its first half results e pected next week to address the difference between its performance and analysts forecasts in the absence of financial guidance analysts said the company was better positioned than other carmakers in terms of tariff e posure because of its high level of local production in the us as well as compliance with a trade deal with me ico and canada that protects the group from higher tariffs the company had previously warned of a net tariff impact of up to bn for the full year bernstein analyst stephen reitman said the large restructuring charge suggested that the board is taking decisive steps and would help with operating margins in the future carmakers have benefited from a recent rela ation of the eu s tough regulations to reduce carbon emissions but jean philippe imparato the european head of stellantis has warned that it still faces the risk of a bn fine due to its light commercial

slightly over a year ago cnn hosted a debate between then president joe biden and former and current president donald trump president biden s approval rating heading into the debate was already low the pew research center s survey in april of showed that the number of u s adults who disapproved of his performance as president vastly outnumbered those who approved times siena polls suggested trump led biden by about among likely voters ahead of the debate and that lead widened to after biden s poor peformance and ultimately he bowed to pressure from his own party to withdraw from the race it was at this point when the prospect of trump returning to the white house went from possibility to probability that economists and investors really began to weigh in on the implications of trumponomics much of what was published at the time e pressed significant concerns about some of his proposals so much so that on july th the economist published an opinion piece entitled trumponomics would not be as bad as most e pect the authors taking a fairly balanced view said mr trump and his advisers have many rotten ideas they also have some decent ones this week marked two milestones it has been si months since mr trump was once again sworn in as president of the united states and the s p just hit another all time high we are also kicking off the first earnings season where publicly traded companies will report a full quarter s worth of operating results under the new administration sp y mountain s p year during this period the markets e perienced historic volatility induced by policy proposals however did the chaos we observed in stock prices reflect chaos in corporate operating results early indications from both economic data and the of the russell that have reported so far since july st are actually pretty good a higher percentage of companies that have reported since july st of this year gave a positive revenue surprise a smaller percentage reported a negative earnings surprise the percentage above consensus for both revenues and earnings is higher this year and earnings have averaged growth yoy well above long term growth rates so was the economist right here are some points to consider while tariff threats have been substantial we still don t know where e actly that will land the government has benefited from additional tariff revenue and some price increases are being seen one potential reason revenues and earnings could rise is that businesses are pricing products in anticipation of tariffs but due to delays the impact has not yet been fully felt economists warned of another inflationary impact cracking down on illegal immigration would increase labor costs so far this too does not appear to be creating huge disruptions but while border crossings have slowed to a trickle deportations while causing a bit of a political firestorm in some cities have a real impact that is muted because by its own reckoning the white house claims deportations since january th at that pace the administration won t be able to deport even of those who entered the country illegally under biden and because they are supposedly focusing on criminals those deportations are not likely to impact wages paid at legitimate industries yet while the white house has been highly critical of fed rate policy generally and chairman jerome powell specifically and the next appointee is likely to be more aligned with trump s rate wishes fomc rate policy is still by committee history has not been kind to political interference in central banking activities and it s likely that even if the new chairman adopts a more dovish stance the fomc will remember the mistakes the fed made during the arthur burns era if they do vote to cut rates i believe it will be based on inflation and employment data not white house rhetoric deficits remain a complete disaster where in the past the predominant parties would at least pay lip service by either demanding higher ta es or lower spending that appears to be out the window in dc these days valuations in several sectors are well above long term averages relative to the market and to their own sector history the most notable e ception is healthcare time to hedge any or all of these factors could reemerge as a threat to equities and while there are still several weeks until labor day it s worth remembering that september and october are months that have seen significant volatility in past years with the cboe volatility inde vi just over as i write this below the year average of and in the th percentile now might be a good time to consider adding some hedges either to high flying constituents of one s portfolio via put spreads or more generally by purchasing some relatively low cost put spreads on an equity market pro y such as spdr s p etf trust spy for e ample the sep th month ending put spread which e pires in days costs less than of the underlying disclosures none all opinions e pressed by the

kenzo tribouillard afp via getty images en english sustainability now reimagining sustainable development for a fractured world jul jozef síkela as developing countries investment needs become increasingly urgent the resources to meet them are steadily dwindling with public finances under strain worldwide the european union s approach aims to mobilize private capital by de risking investment and supporting local initiatives brussels poverty aristotle famously observed is the parent of revolution and crime history has repeatedly proven the point inequality often fuels political and social instability giving rise to conflict and despair today in the face of widening economic disparities and climate disruption international cooperation on sustainable development is no longer just an e pression of solidarity it is a strategic imperative yet just as development challenges grow increasingly urgent the resources to confront them are steadily declining in world leaders adopted the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs outlining a shared vision for a more equitable low carbon future since then however overlapping global crises from the covid pandemic to rising geopolitical tensions and escalating climate change have reversed much of the progress made over the past years the realities of our increasingly multipolar world call for a shift in mindset policymakers must focus on doing more with less which means fostering effective partnerships between the public and private sectors this was my main takeaway from the fourth international conference on financing for development ffd in seville spain to meet climate and social targets we must rethink how development is financed and by whom while every country relies on access to financing to manage crises support growth and provide essential services this need is especially acute in developing countries where investment in infrastructure and human capital is crucial to long term progress to achieve the sdgs developing countries will need to raise roughly trillion annually with development budgets under pressure globally it is clear that public funding alone is not enough and that closing

substitute for private investment that s the thinking behind the european union s global gateway initiative which focuses on creating the conditions necessary for sustainable financing by combining guarantees grants and long term loans it aims to reduce risk unlock private capital and enable transformative investments in high quality infrastructure projects with a strong focus on education job training health and climate resilience at ffd for e ample we signed a million million guarantee agreement with spain s cofides to e pand off grid energy access in underserved regions across sub saharan africa latin america and the caribbean projects like these often cannot move forward without effective risk mitigation by reducing financial e posure eu guarantees help make long term financing viable and more accessible we are also developing innovative financing vehicles such as the digital leap fund which uses grants guarantees and first loss equity to attract private investors to projects they might otherwise avoid the goal is to mobilize up to million for digital infrastructure including g networks data centers and broadband connectivity at the same time we are working to remove barriers to investment as a former international banker i understand that investors tend to seek safe long term returns the kind that well designed development projects can offer but they also need predictability transparency and robust regulatory frameworks our local partners for their part need the capacity to build value chains that align with their strengths and priorities too often developing countries that produce or e tract highly sought after resources retain only a fraction of their final value a cashew grown in africa may be shipped to asia for processing and then e ported to europe delivering limited benefits to local communities while imposing a high environmental cost the eu s value based model tackles this imbalance head on by focusing on three key areas job creation and investment in skills education inclusion and sustainability high quality infrastructure and supporting local ownership governance reform and stable investment conditions this approach is already being implemented in angola and zambia where we are helping to transform the lobito corridor an eu backed project to renovate the railway linking angola to landlocked mineral rich regions in zambia and the democratic republic of the congo into more than just a trade route for critical raw materials to ensure that the economic benefits remain in the region we are supporting vocational training education and local processing in zambia we are using grants to strengthen sustainable agriculture combining value chain development with technical training in beekeeping agro processing and rural entrepreneurship meanwhile in angola we are investing in vocational programs tailored to the transportation logistics and energy industries achieving lasting impact requires long term planning which is why our approach is demand driven skills oriented and focused on creating good jobs and promoting local ownership the namibia green hydrogen program which aims to help namibia realize its green hydrogen potential while supporting europe s energy transition is a prime e ample led by national institutions and developed with private partners like hyphen hydrogen energy the project

often follow with nearly one quarter of the world s population living in areas affected by conflict natural disasters and displacement initiatives like the global gateway help bridge the gap between humanitarian aid and long term development by working to restore essential services and build resilience where it is needed most europe has the tools to lead this effort but lasting progress depends

global financial stability and environmental stability an awareness reflected in new initiatives like the debt suspension clause alliance and the global hub for debt swaps for development while some claim that accounting for climate change amounts to mission creep for global financial stewards like the international monetary fund bellwether investors recognize that nature and climate risks will

benjamin cremel afp via getty images en english pt portuguese sustainability now has trump killed green finance jul howard davies just four years ago the world s banks insurers and asset managers were pledging to align their operations with the goal of achieving net zero emissions in order to mitigate the risks to financial stability posed by climate change now however those pledges have been sharply curtailed owing to us pressure since january edinburgh at the united nations climate change conference in glasgow cop back in mark carney bestrode the financial world like a colossus now canada s prime minister thanks in large part to us president donald trump s call to make the country america s st state in he was the un special envoy for climate action and finance at cop carney announced the creation of the glasgow financial alliance for net zero gfanz the parent of three precocious children the net zero banking alliance nzba the net zero insurance alliance nzia and the net zero asset managers nzam initiative all that amounted to a whole lot of zeros in the view of some sceptics but carney assured an e pectant world that it s not blah blah blah and that net zero would form the critical infrastructure of the new financial system so how well has the glasgow initiative aged at which end of the critical infrastructure blah blah blah spectrum do we find ourselves the intervening years have not been kind to the alphabet soup carney cooked up at the beginning of this year the biggest us banks jp morgan goldman sachs and the rest pulled out of the nzba clearly fearing political pressure from trump s new administration the big us banks were soon followed by the canadian banks showing little loyalty to their future prime minister s creation in april the remaining members watered down the initial commitments focusing on alignment with a ma imum celsius temperature rise rather than the long mooted c and abandoning the target of full net zero compliance by but that did not stem the flow of departures earlier this month hsbc announced its defection and it seems highly likely that others will do likewise today the members represent only a little over half the assets of the founders but there are still some committed banks and the nzba remains alive hottest sale of the summer subscribe now for less hottest sale of the summer subscribe now for less

than can be said for its little sister the nzia even before trump s election some attorneys general from republican controlled states raising concerns about collaborative climate pledges had targeted the major members on antitrust grounds their motives might have been rather different but legally they had a point the founders had not properly thought through the implications of the pledges they were making after a spate of withdrawals in april the nzia collapsed there has been a replacement of sorts in the form of the forum for insurance transition to net zero the forum s membership obligations are more fle ible and there are no targets or reporting obligations it also claims to have armed itself with in house lawyers to guard against any potential future contraventions of antitrust law to complete the set the third child the nzam also e perienced a spate of withdrawals in january led by blackrock that led to a suspension of its activities and the removal of its published list of signatories it is not clear when if ever the suspension will be lifted we have accounted for the children but what about the parent gfanz still technically e ists but has been substantially remodeled it now describes itself as an independent principals group with no pre entry qualifications and has shifted its focus from being a net zero gatekeeper to becoming a facilitator of finance to fund the energy transition a worthy task but far from what was initially envisaged it is hard to see these developments taken together as anything other than a significant watering down of the financial sector s commitment to supporting the green transition but where are the regulators who were e erting pressure on their charges to step up and ensure that they were part of the climate change solution rather than being casualties of the problem the network for greening the financial system ngfs was created by a coalition of eight willing central banks in the coalition included the united kingdom france and china but not the united states after joe biden s election in the federal reserve which prides itself on its political independence decided to join only to withdraw earlier this year but in this case other central banks remain committed some like the bank of england have de emphasized their climate stress tests but ngfs members now numbering some still believe that rising average temperatures threaten economic disruption and that the energy transition will create winners and losers recent analysis by the ngfs suggests that the economic risks are greater than previously thought if banks and insurers do not understand the implications they may be adversely affected adding financial instability to the other threats we face it would be idle to imagine though that the rest of the world can continue as before there are unmistakable signs that the us is putting pressure on international regulatory bodies to downgrade their climate related work the last communiqué from the financial stability board noted that while many members feel there is a need for more work some feel that the work completed to date is sufficient and it seems that the some have dominated the many similarly the basel committee has downgraded its work on climate related disclosures and removed any requirement to comply the basel committee did refuse a us request to disband its climate task force but the us representatives reportedly simply do not turn up which clearly impacts its effectiveness so where do we go from here all the scientific evidence suggests that the impact of global warming on the financial sector is growing relentlessly but us resistance to any resulting action by firms or their regulators is becoming firmer the outcome of a clash between an irresistible force and an immovable object is notoriously hard to predict in this case my bet is on the irresistible force a bad outcome perhaps first in the insurance world will illustrate the

published version thank you eric thank you to the fed staff who have organized this second annual financial inclusion conference and thank you all for being here i have long believed that financial inclusion is a crucial component of a safe and fair financial system working to improve financial inclusion has been an important part of my career starting in when i joined the treasury department and worked with colleagues to build community development financial institutions strengthen the community reinvestment act and launch the new markets initiative at the university of michigan financial inclusion was key to programs i worked on to support minority entrepreneurship with the support of both the public and private sectors there have been many improvements and advancements in financial inclusion over the last three decades evidenced by the decline in the rate of people who are unbanked and the increasing reach and success of programs such as the bank on initiative that better meet the needs of low income customers i welcome this progress but there is so much more to do to deepen and widen financial inclusion to many millions of people in america who could benefit from it better access to affordable financial services geared to the needs of underserved families and entrepreneurs can help them to build more secure lives stronger communities and a stronger american economy financial inclusion contributes to the federal reserve s mission of promoting a healthy and growing economy and a safe and stable financial system consumers are two thirds of economic activity so access to credit for low and moderate income households and small businesses helps the economy to grow in addition the fed has an important role in implementing a series of laws passed by congress related to access to credit such as the community reinvestment act as we learned during the global financial crisis household finances are crucial to a strong and stable financial system in my remarks today i would like to go through several ways that the public and private sectors are helping to increase financial inclusion those efforts include greater access to bank accounts and financial services faster payments services responsible small dollar lending methods and the use of alternative data to promote credit access these efforts have shown promise in e panding financial inclusion bank account access is the foundation to financial inclusionfinancial inclusion begins with access to basic bank account services while financial services are evolving rapidlyâ with new forms of financial intermediation payment services and even deposit like money claimsâ it is still the case that access to a bank account is the foundation for helping families and businesses get the financial services they need bank accounts provide access to direct deposit of paychecks benefit payments and ta refunds bank accounts provide connections to peer to peer payment systems and for the vast majority of retail and wholesale payments bank accounts are also often the entry point for access to credit for households and businesses according to the federal deposit insurance corporation s national survey of unbanked and underbanked households the number of americans without bank accounts is at the lowest it has been since the survey began in yet there remain groups that struggle with low account access including those who are disabled those without a high school diploma and minority groups among others households that include someone of working age with a disability are three times as likely to be unbanked as working age households without a disability meanwhile hispanic and african american households and american indian and alaskan native households are five and si times as likely respectively to be unbanked as white households the unbanked cite account opening costs unpredictable or high fees and high minimum balance requirements as among the top reasons for not obtaining bank accounts e pansion of banking accessone private sector program that has helped to address barriers to account access is the bank on program supported by the cities for financial empowerment fund cfef bank on is led by coalitions of regional financial institutions community groups and local governments working together to bring households into the financial system cfef certifies that bank on accounts meet standards including low minimum deposits for account opening low maintenance overdraft or other une pected fees and free branch atm online and mobile banking over bank branches nationwide offer a certified bank on account an important way that the program has spread and taken root in communities is through the coalition model which involves establishing relationships with local and state governments public officials and community organizations these partners engaged with and trusted by their communities have helped overcome apprehension about bank accounts and helped drive the outreach needed for any business to find new customers the federal reserve system has long been a partner of the bank on initiative in the federal reserve bank of san francisco was a partner in creating the first coalition at the st louis fed the publicly available bank on national data hub bond was created in to help identify the availability of certified accounts bank on coalitions across the country continue to partner on engagement outreach and data collection with their regional reserve banks to offer safe and affordable bank accounts faster paymentsfinancial inclusion also requires timely access to funds people living paycheck to paycheck incur the greatest costs of waiting for these funds one of the primary benefits of a bank account over time is facilitating payments technological advances have driven improvement in this area sometimes only incrementally but the more recent advent of real time paymentsâ especially new services for instant or immediate paymentsâ has the potential to make a big leap forward in service to households and businesses cash strapped households and businesses need access to their funds right away and they need reliable ways to pay e penses when they are due and when they have the funds to pay them low income households may need quick access to make just in time transactions such as same day utility bill payment through their bank or to quickly receive funds from a family member to cover an emergency e pense like an unanticipated car repair while the benefits of getting instantaneous access to paychecks are obvious the value of controlling precisely when and in what order payments settle may be less appreciated with real time payments households and businesses can have better control over payment flows helping them for e ample to avoid une pected and unwelcome overdraft and nonsufficient funds fees many other countries are seeking methods to improve the speed of payments in india for e ample the implementation of the unified payments interface upi which is the country s digital instant funds transfer system has allowed consumers to see some of these benefits in action upi is available for free on a customer s mobile device and can be used for merchant payments bill payments and money transfers among other things since its implementation the reserve bank of india has noted an increase in financial inclusion particularly in rural areas where bank branch access is difficult we have seen the benefits of technological advancement and innovation here in the u s as well today technologies to improve the speed of payments are being implemented across platforms and products providing consumers various ways to move money quickly and easily the federal reserve as a part of its mission to foster a safe efficient and widely accessible payments infrastructure is playing a role as well as we have in the past and in collaboration with the private sector we have worked to innovate the payment system using the latest technology to better meet the needs of businesses and households in we launched fednow an interbank payment system for banks and credit unions of all sizes to instantly and securely transfer money for their customers any time of the day on any day of the year we are encouraged by innovative private sector engagement with the new platform and instant payment services generally we are already seeing early adopters rolling out new services that can benefit consumers one e ample is the ability for gig economy workers to gain instant access to earned wages which can make a big difference in household cash flow management we e pect these types of innovations will continue to e pand in the coming years and be delivered in new conte ts ultimately bringing broad benefits to liquidity constrained households and small businesses that need to tightly manage payment inflows and outflows small dollar lendingaccess to small dollar loans from banks can help consumers smooth through the ups and downs of income and e penses i think many people would be surprised how widely this help is needed according to the fed s survey of household economics and decisionmaking when asked how they would respond if confronted with an une pected e pense nearly percent of adults said they would have paid at least in part by selling something using a payday loan deposit advance or overdraft or would not be able to pay for the e pense when looking at households with incomes of under this number increases to percent access to reasonably priced credit to cover these sorts of e penses is therefore a common need especially among those with lower incomes these households have no financial slack in contrast to the more costly and riskier sources of credit that i mentioned we are seeing bank offered products that are helping to increase access to safer lower cost forms of small dollar lending the fed and other bank regulators took a helpful step in this regard in by issuing guidance according to that guidance responsible small dollar loan programs must treat customers fairly have effectively managed risks and be underwritten based on prudent policies that means first that products are offered in a way that most customers successfully repay their small dollar loans in accordance with original loan terms which is a key indicator of affordability eligibility and appropriate underwriting second it means repayment terms pricing and safeguards minimize adverse customer outcomes including cycles of debt due to rollovers or reborrowing and finally it means repayment outcomes and program structures enhance a borrower s financial capabilities by contributing positively to their record of servicing debts most banks that have offered small dollar loan products since follow these principles and it has had a positive impact on the loan terms they offer loan terms have better matched customer needs and rates have come down small dollar loans that have the potential to disrupt the market for costly alternative financial services are bank products that provide a straightforward application process clear loan terms certainty about approval strong likelihood of repayment and quick disbursement of funds alternative financial dataanother channel for improving financial inclusion is the use of alternative financial data to supplement the traditional measures that banks have relied on to judge the creditworthiness of borrowers with limited or no traditional borrowing history for e ample lenders can evaluate cash flowâ steady income and bill paymentsâ as a measure of the likelihood of loan repayment alternative data can help lenders take a second look for consumers who would otherwise not qualify based on the more traditional credit score based underwriting models in addition to making less e pensive and more suitable loans available alternative data often allows faster loan decisions this is an important consideration for low and moderate income borrowers who tend to have little savings and struggle with meeting an une pected e pense technological advances such as application programming interfaces apis a set of specifications that can allow software to communicate with each other can also help lenders access permissioned consumer financial data that can be used for underwriting apis also facilitate automated application decisionmaking and fund delivery let me conclude by returning to where i started which is the crucial role of access to safe transparent and low cost bank accounts as the gateway to financial inclusion we have made great progress but i am certain that there are still many people whose finances and lives could improve with a bank account suited to their needs and economic circumstances i applaud the work of financial inclusion leaders in doing what they can to make bank accounts available and better tailored to the needs of low and moderate income households

innovation in the financial sector playing an important role this year s conference builds upon increased engagement across both the public and private sectors with a collective effort to leverage technology to broaden financial service access and improve the financial well being of consumers and small businesses the federal reserve will continue to play an important role in these efforts

financial services and the role that our policies and practices play in promoting inclusion progress to datebanks of all sizes are working to improve access to financial services for all americans as i ve noted in the past the u s banking system is well positioned to bring consumers and small businesses into the financial mainstream by providing access to safe fair and responsive financial products and services these efforts greatly benefit from our continued focus on broader access and innovation including understanding how our supervisory and regulatory framework either supports or impairs a bank s ability to provide affordable financial services that are consistent with safety and soundness innovation comes in many forms one e ample is through banks use of alternative data which can enable banks to provide services like affordable small dollar loans or to provide access to credit invisibles who may not have access to loans and other financial services from traditional lenders this growing area of focus also helps align financial service offerings with a customer s financial goals a well functioning financial system provides a foundation for strong consumer financial health to further this the federal banking agencies recently published a request for information on check and payments fraud to help address the impact of this growing problem on banks and

you ve safely connected to the gov website share sensitive information only on official secure websites the federal reserve the central bank of the united states provides the nation with a safe fle ible and stable monetary and financial system at the federal reserve bank of dallas dallas te as thank you lorie let me start by e pressing my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those harmed by the flooding in the hill country i cannot imagine the pain and anguish they are feeling my prayers go out to all those affected turning to my remarks for today thank you also for the opportunity to speak to you about the fed s balance sheet one of the more comple and i believe misunderstood aspects of the federal reserve s role as a central bank to level set the conversation let me start with some simple facts in august of our balance sheet was around billion equal to appro imately percent of nominal gross domestic product gdp today it is around trillion with at which is about percent of gdp this is down significantly from its ma imum size of nearly trillion in early but still quite large since nominal gdp has essentially doubled since if our balance sheet had grown at the same rate it would be around trillion todayâ not trillion an obvious question is why our balance sheet is so much larger than economic growth would have predicted as an aside let me point out that there is no consensus among economists about how large a central bank balance sheet should be but it is logical to ask if monetary policy worked when the balance sheet was percent of gdp why is it and perhaps needs to be proportionally so much larger now a major reason is that the federal reserve embarked on two major balance sheet policy initiatives over the past twenty years to respond to urgent problems in the economy first we engaged in quantitative easing or qe to provide support to the economy after the advent of the global financial crisis and then again with the covid pandemic second we consciously changed our implementation framework for providing liquidity to the banking system by moving from a scarce reserves system to an ample reserves system this change was necessary because there were shortcomings with the scarce reserves approachâ short term rates were harder to control and required daily interventions in the markets by the fed and these problems were made worse when rates were at or near zero the federal open market committee fomc e plicitly stated its commitment to ample reserves in when we were gradually shrinking our balance sheet concluding that this approach would be used over the longer run and it soon proved very useful when the pandemic again brought rates to zero although these are two fundamentally different reasons for changing the size of our balance sheet we did them more or less at the same time this has caused confusion with some people thinking that the fed is choosing to keep the balance sheet larger than it needs to be this confusion is amplified by the fact that there are e ternal forces that have boosted the size of our balance sheet that are not under the control of the federal reserve my goal today in this speech is to disentangle each of these forces and try to demystify the role of our balance sheet in conducting monetary policy i also want to clarify issues that are currently being discussed in the public domain i agree that the balance sheet needs to shrink but as i will show not by as much as some believe it should i will also e plain why the composition of the balance sheet matters as much as its size and how changes are needed there as well i know from teaching this topic over the years to my undergraduate students that unless you are an accountant or a banker you would probably rather go to the dentist than listen to a speech about the fed s balance sheet i hope to e plain it clearly enough that you can leave here and engage in the public debate with a better understanding of the issues to do so the approach i want to take is the following suppose the fed had never used quantitative easing and simply decided to move to an ample reserves system from a scarce reserves system how would the liability and asset sides of our balance sheet change in response to this one policy decision after addressing this question i will then discuss how qe affects our balance sheet and also some difficult tradeoffs that arise when engaging in qe the big three liabilitiesfor any balance sheet we start with the asset and liability entries assets are things that are owned and liabilities are things that are owed to others at a given point in time i will start by listing the big three liabilities on the fed s balance sheet and the characteristics of those liabilities there are other types of liabilities and capital that must be accounted for but they are too small to matter for the policy matters i want to discuss so i will ignore them after discussing these big three liabilities we can consider what assets should be held to match those liabilities the first big liability of the federal reserve is currency outstanding the fed supplies u s dollars elastically to the public based on demand distributing dollars through banks that demand which is not controlled by the fed is basically determined by how fast the economyâ and thus the need for cashâ is growing at the end of the amount of dollars in circulation was trillion that is up considerably from around billion in after which the overall balance sheet began growing sharply even in terms of gdp currency has increased from percent of gdp in to almost percent today so an important point that many do not realize is that the fed s balance sheet has e panded especially in nominal terms from increased demand for u s currency what are the characteristics of currency as a liability first it is non interest bearing second it never matures as other debt obligations do let s just say that currency is different from other liabilitiesâ it pays no interest and you never get back your initial payment for acquiring it if you come to the fed and ask us to redeem a dollar bill we will simply give you another dollar bill the second big liability is the treasury general account or tga the federal reserve is the fiscal agent of the u s treasury which means that we are the bank for the u s government and the tga is the treasury s checking account what are the characteristics of the tga first it is a short term liability that moves up and down as cash flows in and out of the account as the treasury receives ta and other payments and pays its bills second we do not pay interest to the treasury on its account balances finally given the asynchronous timing of payments and receipts the tga can vary significantly especially when the debt ceiling is binding during it generally fluctuated between about billion and billion briefly peaking at around billion during the april ta season due to this year s debt ceiling constraint the tga fell from its average of billion to about billion recently and with the debt ceiling just increased there will be a quick rebuild in the coming weeks so it is not unusual for the tga to fluctuate by several hundred billion dollars this situation is very different than the one in when the tga was deliberately held steady at billion each day this change reflects both how much federal spending has grown in that time and also a shift in accounting in to holding an estimated week s worth of federal payments in the tgaâ a decision made by the treasury to better manage its cash flow an important point that applies to both currency and the tga is that the federal reserve does not have control over the size of these liabilities and hasn t been responsible for their sharp increases together they represent about trillion of our trillion balance sheet or roughly percent of nominal gross domestic product so the size of the fed s balance sheet which is now about percent of nominal gdp is nearly half accounted for by these two liabilities that are not under the fed s control those who argue that the fed could go back to when its total balance sheet was percent of gdp fail to recognize that these two factors make it impossible the third big liability on the fed s balance sheet is reserves which are the funds that depository institutions hold in accounts at the fed in effect these are the checking account balances of the banking system that are held at the federal reserve what is the characteristic of reserves held by banks first much like the tga they are short term in nature and very liquidâ in effect like digital cash they are the safest and most liquid asset in the financial system and used to conduct payments between banks the reserve balances that an individual bank holds can increase or decrease depending on the flow of payments between banks much like the tga an individual bank s reserve holdings can be volatile but these payments do not change the total amount of reserves in the banking systemâ they simply transfer them from one bank to another so while reserve balances of individual banks can move around total reserves are more stable and the total amount of reserves in the system is directly controlled by the federal reserve second in october congress authorized the federal reserve to pay interest on these liabilities besides ending the implicit ta on banks for holding reserves it was a step aimed at helping the fed conduct monetary policy effectively which it does but it is sometimes inaccurately criticized as a giveaway to banks i will address this point a little later but i mention it here because the amount of reserves in the system affects the total payment flow the fed must make to banks at the current interest rate on reserves assets backing these liabilitiesby the definition of a balance sheet these liabilities must be matched by assets held by the federal reserve let s consider matching assets to our currency liability as i said earlier currency pays no interest and never matures so we can hold assets of any maturity length to offset our liability for currency since currency pays no interest any interest earned off these assets is pure profit given that longer maturity assets generally pay higher interest rates and are less volatile it seems reasonable to hold longer maturity assets against our currency liability now consider the tga liability we also pay no interest on the tga but unlike currency a problem with the tga is that it can vary substantially which makes total reserves in the system more volatile this link to reserves is because when ta payments are made to the treasury we debit the payer s bank reserves and credit the treasury s tga account when the treasury makes a payment we debit the tga and credit the recipient bank s reserve account thus volatile movements in the tga affect the fed s reserve management policy there are two ways to deal with this situation hold a buffer of reserves to ensure movements in the tga do not affect market liquidity or hold short maturity assets that we can e pand or contract to sterilize movements in the tga such that total reserves in the banking system are unchanged the first strategy suggests the buffer stock of assets could take the form of somewhat longer maturity while the second strategy could require holding short term assets that can easily be bought and sold with little interest rate risk that brings us to reserves as i mentioned reserves are a short maturity liability which pay interest which suggests that the fed should consider holding short maturity assets against this liability treasury bills and short maturity treasury notes are the safest and most liquid assets so it would make sense to hold them against reserves if the interest rate earned on our short maturity treasury assets is very close to the interest we pay on reserves then our interest earnings from the treasury are simply passed through to the banks in this sense our balance sheet is just another way to transfer interest payments on treasury securities from the treasury to the banks because of the minimal spread between these two short term interest rates banks are largely indifferent to either holding reserves or the short term treasury securities we holdâ both are highly liquid and pay roughly the same rate of return but layer on top of this the fact that reserves are a bit more liquid than treasury securities because banks don t have to buy or sell the treasury securities to get reserves and banks are willing to hold a lot of reserves since the fed supplies these reserves one might ask what it costs ta payers to supply a large amount of reserves from the treasury s point of view its interest e pense is the same regardless of who holds the short term treasury securities so the fed can provide all the liquidity that banks need at zero marginal cost which makes me wonder why some want to make reserves scarce i often use the following analogy to drive this point home if governments could provide clean safe drinking water for citizens at zero cost why would they make it scarce now one could ask why pay interest on reserves at all why not keep the interest income generated on the assets we hold to back reserves and remit it back to the treasury this seems like a no brainer but there are a few reasons that interest on reserves makes sense including the following first paying interest on reserves that is commensurate to the rate paid on short term treasury securities makes reserves attractive to banks and holding reserves improves the functioning of the financial system by giving banks more liquidity and greater scope to settle payments in an orderly way in contrast if reserves bear no interest then commercial banks will have strong incentives to avoid holding a lot of reserves and instead hold short term interest bearing assets like treasury bills if banks managed their liquidity only by buying and selling treasury securities several banks selling treasury securities at the same time could flood the market and put undesirable upward pressure on interest rates across the economy an ample reserves regime where we pay interest on reserves ensures that there are enough reserves in the banking system to avoid this kind of sell off in treasury securities helping to stabilize the financial system without any harm to banks or their customers the second part of the case for interest on reserves is that it isn t costing ta payers any money as i noted earlier whether the fed or banks hold the treasury securities the treasury is paying interest on its debt and if the fed is holding the treasury securities then the interest payment from the treasury to the fed on the treasury bills is matched with an interest payment from the fed to banks on their reserves so paying interest on reserves is not creating any additional e pense to the treasury but what is the appropriate level of ample reserves the fed is trying to get to there is no clear answer to this question and that is what we are trying to discern we want to provide the amount of liquidity necessary but we don t want to provide e cessive liquidity that banks do not want or need one reason for increased demand for reserves is that since the global financial crisis changes in banking regulations led to a large shift in demand for high quality liquid assets for e ample bank liquidity regulations such as the liquidity coverage ratio encouraged banks to hold high quality liquid assets as these regulations came into play banks demand for high quality liquid assets including reserves increased tremendously relative to i think of ample reserves as the threshold below which banks would need to scramble to find safe liquid funding something that would drive up the federal funds rate and money market interest rates across the economy we have some e perience with testing the level of ample reserves during an episode of stress in the financial system that occurred in at the start of that year reserves stood at about percent of nominal gdp and we were continuing to reduce our balance sheet with no apparent stress among banks or otherwise in the financial system in september reserves fell below percent of nominal gdp and stresses appeared in the financial system requiring the fed to step in and take action to add reserves so i start from the view that problems emerged when reserves fell below percent of gdp one might argue that banks are now larger relative to gdp so they may desire a bit more reserves furthermore there is also a genuine concern that it is not only the total amount of reserves that matters but also the distribution of reserves across the banking system so i would add a buffer to the percent of gdp that i cited earlier and assume percent is the threshold below which reserves would not be ample that would mean as of today that trillion of reserves is roughly ampleâ it could be more or less in practice but let me use it as a benchmark so putting the pieces of this hypothetical minimum balance sheet together we have an estimated trillion in reserve balances trillion in currency and an average of billion in tga liabilities this combined means the fed should be operating with a balance sheet that is roughly trillion dollars or percent of gdp close to half of this proportional increase from as i noted comes from currency and tga growth outside the fed s control and the rest from a transition to an ample reserves regime that has been a necessary efficient and more effective way of managing monetary policy in summary if we had simply adopted an ample reserves system and backed these liabilities as i suggested without engaging in quantitative easing there are three key takeaways we would be earning a net profit off of the assets backing currency and the tga the assets backing ample reserves would simply be a way to transfer interest payments to the banks and we would hold short to medium term assets that could be bought or sold to neutralize large movements in the tga to keep total reserves stable with this balance sheet the federal reserve would never run losses the banks would have ample liquidity for market functioning and the fed would not face serious interest rate risk on its asset holdings today s balance sheet and where we are headingat this point there are going to be people somewhere shaking their fists and yelling that what i have said is simply false because the federal reserve is currently losing money on its balance sheet our interest e pense on reserves is now e ceeding our interest income on our asset holdings this is all true but this outcome is because of engaging in qe for many years since not because we are running an ample reserves system remember what i have described so far is what an optimally designed balance sheet would look like if we had never engaged in qe and simply moved to an ample reserves system let me now do the following assume we have a balance sheet that corresponds to an ample reserves system but now the fed engages in qe as a means of conducting monetary policy to support the economy the federal reserve engaged in qe programs when the policy rate was driven down to zero because of severe shocks to the economy after the global financial crisis and then because of the covid pandemic once the policy rate is at zero the federal reserve is constrained in its ability to use its traditional tools to provide further support for the economy the idea of qe is to buy longer duration securities as opposed to short duration assets by increasing the demand for long dated securities the fed drives up the price and drives down the yield on those securities by lowering longer term yields the fed is able to loosen financing conditions to stimulate aggregate demand the fed typically buys longer dated treasury securities during qe but it also bought agency mortgage backed securities that have the implicit backing of the u s treasury and are issued by fannie mae and freddie mac the two government sponsored enterprises qe affects our balance sheet in material ways that differ from what happens if one is simply constructing the balance sheet to support ample reserves currency and the tga first it increases the duration of our balance sheet beyond what we would hold just for currency longer duration assets are more prone to interest rate risk and the lower the interest rates on those assets the lower interest income the fed will receive far into the future if interest rates rise suddenly or over time as the economy recovers those assets lose value in substantial amounts which lowers the unrealized value of our portfolio second we use short term reserves to buy the longer duration assets which leads to a maturity mismatch between our assets and our liabilities so the additional reserves that are injected from qe may not be costless when short term rates rise as they did in meaning that interest paid on those additional reserves will e ceed what is earned on the long term assets that were purchased with them this effect highlights the fact that engaging in qe involves a tradeoff for the federal reserveâ trying to support the economy in serious economic downturns at the zero lower bound while creating a maturity mismatch between our assets and liabilities that brings interest rate risk onto our balance sheet this tradeoff does not happen if we simply structure our balance sheet to support an ample reserves system the decision to engage in qe requires the federal reserve to weigh the benefits and costs from this action those benefits and costs are often difficult to quantify at the time qe is undertaken it is only with hindsight that we can fully assess them which is one of the challenges of making policy in real time where do we stand today the federal reserve is operating with an abundant or more than ample level of reserves and our securities holdings are tilted toward longer dated maturities we are shrinking the balance sheet to get back to a size consistent with an ample reserves system as of last month banks had nearly trillion of reserves with the fed accounting for about percent of nominal gdp given my rough estimate of the level of reserves needed to be ample i believe we can likely continue to let a share of maturing and prepaying securities roll off our balance sheet for some time reducing reserve balances of course we will continue to carefully monitor financial markets as we go for me the bigger problem with our balance sheet is that the maturity structure of our assets to support an ample reserves system is not well matched we have far too many long term assets on our balance sheet relative to my arguments for how to structure the balance sheet i argued that long term assets should only be held against currency liabilities which are trillion but we hold about trillion in agency mortgage backed securities alone so the duration of our asset portfolio is far too long for the liabilities we need to hold for an ample reserves system if the fed moved forward with a maturity matching strategy as i suggest it would hold about half of its treasury securities in shorter dated bills there have been some advocates who support moving toward the federal reserve having a treasury securities portfolio whose composition mimics the breakdown or universe of total treasury securities outstanding this would mean having about percent of our current balance sheet in bills the argument for this maturity structure is that with this approach the fed s holdings would not be putting pressure on any one segment of the yield curve this is a valid argument but it would put more duration on our balance sheet and e pose the fed to potential income losses as we have witnessed the past few years maybe that is a tradeoff we should make to avoid distorting our demand for treasury securities relative to the market s demand in the end i support continuing the conversation about what the ultimate composition should be my objective today was to try to clarify what an ample reserves balance sheet should look like as a starting point for this conversation in the years ahead moving our portfolio toward shorter duration securities will be a slow process unless we were to take the dramatic step of selling existing securities to replace them with treasury bills when reserves hit their desired ample level and we need to increase securities holdings in line with growth in autonomous factors like currency and the tga we can actively accumulate bills if we do not take other actions sooner i hope that taking a deep dive into a few line items on the fed s balance sheet has helped to see some issues that lie ahead though the fomc has not finalized its desired efficient and effective size and composition of the balance sheet it seems apparent that today s portfolio should be adjusted and there are obvious steps to take we are reducing the size of the balance sheet slowly and need to consider shifting it toward more bills as we do so we should do it gradually and predictably so the markets and public are fully aware of our actions the views e pressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues

to the conference organizers for asking me to speak today and thank you especially to the practitioners here for the work you do in building stronger communities your mission has also been at the center of my career in many different roles as an academic a practitioner and a public official starting as the treasury department s point person on community development way back in the s community development has been an important part of my work ever since as a professor a university leader and most recently a banking regulator i think this might help you understand how thrilled i am to have recently taken on the role of consumer and community development point person among the members of the board of governors in support of eric and his team and of the cd function throughout the fed system strong and sustainable communities are crucial to the federal reserve s mission of promoting a healthy economy and a stable financial system under the community reinvestment act cra the fed has a statutory obligation to supervise how banks meet the credit needs of the communities they serve consistent with safe and sound lending practices our community development work reinforces the benefits of this effort more broadly community development work helps the fed support a strong and healthy economy our primary tool for doing this is monetary policy monetary policy influences interest rates and financial conditions to affect economic activity we adjust interest rates in service of seeking price stability and ma imum employment for the american people let me spend just a moment on the u s economy and the outlook the economy is currently on a sound footing with low and steady unemployment and disinflation having continued at a gradual albeit uneven pace toward our percent target low income households can ill afford increases in prices and that s why it is so important that we bring inflation back down to our target looking forward however i e pect tariffs will put upward pressure on inflation higher short term inflation expectations supply chain adjustments and second round effects may cause some inflation persistence at the same time tariffs may cause the economy to slow and unemployment to rise low income workers are often hit the hardest when the job market weakens there is still considerable uncertainty about tariff policies and their effects monetary policy is well positioned to allow us to wait and see how economic conditions unfold turning from monetary policy to community development let me e plain how community development also serves the goals of supporting a healthy economy that works for all americans while monetary policy matters a lot other factors have to come together for people to have good job opportunities businesses need access to credit to e pand and hire and in many communities that credit depends on the cra community development financial institutions and a range of other public policies businesses need qualified workers and in many places that depends on workforce development that is supported by community development organizations businesses that invest to create jobs need to believe in the future and believe in the future of the communities they serve thriving businesses and productive workers need safe healthy strong and sustainable communities these conditions are fundamental to achieving the federal reserve s goals that congress has established in every communitythat is a big reason why the fed s community development function is such an important part of the federal reserve system getting monetary policy decisions right requires a deep understanding of the conditions of local economies across the nation this need is one of the reasons that the fed was designed as an institution with a presence in every region of the country ensuring that the e periences and perspectives of people from everywhere are considered in the decisions we make it is why the federal reserve is actively seeking input from the public in formulating our long term goals and strategy for monetary policy with listening sessions around the country including one right here at the cleveland fed we want to hear from as many communities as we can and an important way to do that is through our long standing connections to organizations that are supporting strong and sustainable communities in addition to the work you do we value your perspectives especially on how low and moderate income communities are faring in the economy federal reserve policymakers depend on a lot of data such as the unemployment rate in making our decisions but numbers can only go so far and we also rely on actual e periences on the ground of people like you and those you serve beyond providing insights on economic conditions the fed s community development function supports the economy by promoting access to credit and other financial services among small businesses and low and moderate income households and communities this access is a cornerstone of economic opportunity and resiliency by analyzing and disseminating information on local financial needs and highlighting successful approaches for attracting and deploying capital the fed s community development work advances economic vitality in communities across america the fed staff who work on community development also work closely with the supervisors overseeing bank compliance with the community reinvestment act by ensuring that these two functions are working together we can support financial institutions awareness of promising opportunities to meet their obligations under the cra beyond supporting these statutory obligations the insights gathered by the fed s cd function serve as an early warning system of risks in the financial system cd programs help spot emerging trends that may for e ample reveal patterns of unfair treatment of borrowers or signal risks to the safety and soundness of lending practices in particular communities what makes community development worki ve outlined the important role that support for community development plays at the federal reserve now i d like to offer a few words on effective community developmentâ what works and some ideas for how it might work even better while we have learned a great deal over the years about promoting healthy and vibrant people and places there are substantial opportunities to e pand and adapt successful approaches to new areas as an institution committed to conducting and disseminating high quality independent and actionable research the federal reserve will continue to conduct and support research on community development and policymakers including me will highlight that research and engage with the public on new ideas for creating economic opportunity particularly in low and moderate income communities this includes conducting original quantitative research to shed new light on evolving challenges such as the federal reserve bank of st louis recent research looking into the incidence of youth disconnection from the labor force and education and how that differs across communities as far as collecting data i would also point to our community perspectives survey and the small business credit survey which the cleveland fed has conducted since beyond collecting and analyzing data the federal reserve s cd function also conducts qualitative research to understand the why behind the data for e ample the philadelphia fed recently published insights from their conversations with employers in the manufacturing as well as the leisure and hospitality sectors in pennsylvania new jersey and delaware on how they are addressing staffing challenges another way that the fed helps advance knowledge is through convenings like the one we re a part of today for e ample the san francisco fed recently hosted the california rural success summit which aimed to connect rural stakeholders across the state and to showcase innovative efforts to enhance access to jobs and credit across rural california these convenings can also take the form of virtual events such as the new york fed s recent webinar e ploring local approaches to developing and rehabbing affordable apartments these are a few of the ways that the fed s community development work helps e pand knowledge across the field communities also need to know how to apply that knowledge and have access to the partners and resources needed to do so the federal reserve s cd function convenes local stakeholders who have a common interest in looking for ways to create opportunities and partnerships to better serve community development needs for e ample the federal reserve bank of boston has been supporting community leaders for more than a decade through its working places initiative which helps local leaders work together to build strong healthy economies and communities similarly through the advance together initiative the dallas fed supports local communities across the th district that are addressing education and employment challenges to connect more te ans with quality jobs the atlanta fed helped to establish and continues to actively participate in the metro atlanta e change for workforce solutions a connector for workforce developers in the area ma as it is known helps bring together employers with those involved in training apprenticeships and certification programs to fill specific demands and lastly i would include the occupational mobility e plorer an interactive tool developed by the federal reserve banks of cleveland and philadelphia that allows workers to explore career paths and visualize how job skills can transfer to higher paying occupations fed cd staff also help investors and community development organizations connect with each other to explore mutually beneficial opportunities to work together through initiatives like the kansas city fed s investment connection and the richmond fed s rural investment collaborative the federal reserve helps communities identify potential financing partners who can move their ideas to action these are just some of the ways the federal reserve supports the work of community development practitioners who as i have described in turn support the federal reserve s work of promoting a healthy economy and a safe and stable financial system thank you for the

getting there is laid out in the fed s policy framework which we plan to update later this year and setting that strategy to reach our goals is informed by outreach like the session today monetary policy decisions affect everyone stable prices are important for families and businesses to be able to plan for the future and for sustainable and healthy labor markets when we get it right we can help foster broad and inclusive employment gains that benefit the american people our decisions play a role for e ample in the prices for agricultural commodities that are particularly important for businesses and consumers in this region these decisions affect the labor market including the challenges that businesses can face in finding qualified workers which i know is a bigger issue in nebraska with lower unemployment than in some other places but the federal reserve s role is a limited oneâ most of what affects the economy are the individual decisions of households and businesses the primary tool for monetary policy is short term interest rates which in turn can affect longer term rates that you your customers and people in your communities pay to finance land and equipment and other inputs credit has always played a particularly important role in agriculture so i know that interest rates matter a lot in this part of america let me emphasize that real world rates are significantly affected by other forces in the economy but fed policy does play a role monetary policy sometimes requires tradeoffsâ a stance of policy that is necessary to lower inflation for e ample may also lower aggregate demand and slow the economy crucial in balancing our economic goals is determining how policy decisions affect households and businesses which is why we are here to listen to

conference sponsored by the international journal of central banking and the czech national bank prague czech republic thank you for the invitation to join you today as the federal reserve s vice chair for supervision i am responsible for among other things leading the board s division of supervision and regulation in its work to promote the safe and sound operation of the u s banking system while this includes the specific activities of bank supervision and regulation the financial system reaches far beyond the banking system regulators must also monitor the effects of activities that e tend outside this perimeter for e ample activities that have migrated from banks to non banks or when there are broader market implications of regulatory actions and their potential effects on financial stability regulations should not be created in a static world of set it and forget it today my remarks will focus specifically on how the passage of timeâ with underlying changes in the composition of the economy and the financial system interest rate shifts and patterns and preferences of banking and financial activityâ can lead to unintended policy application and une pected consequences regulators should consider these broader evolving dynamics as they craft regulations to endure beyond today s circumstances typically these effects are not contemplated in the scope of the usual cost benefit analysis as shifts occur over time after a new rule or regulation is implemented or enacted but shifts can in effect become new policy choices with consequences that can pose significant issues one shift in particular is that of the supplementary leverage ratio increasingly becoming the binding capital constraint for the largest banks in the united states the u s banking system includes two basic types of capital requirements risk based requirements that impose a capital charge based on the underlying risk of a particular activity and leverage based requirements that do not differentiate based on the risk characteristics of underlying assets and while leverage based capital requirements are generally intended to operate as a backstop to risk based requirements changes in the financial system and the broader economy can alter this relationship between capital requirements this shift in the nature of leverage based capital requirements from backstop to binding constraint was not driven by a deliberate policymaking process but rather by the maintenance of a high level of reserves in the banking system as well as the introduction of liquidity requirements that compelled banks to replace loans with high quality liquid assets monetary policy and economic outlookbefore turning to the main theme of my remarks i would like to give a brief update on my outlook for the economy and monetary policy at the federal open market committee fomc meeting last week the committee voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to â percent and to continue to reduce the federal reserve s securities holdings i supported this decision because the data shows a solid labor market and i would like to see further confirmation that inflation is close to our percent target on a sustained basis if inflation remains near its current level or continues to move closer to our target or if the data show signs of weakening in labor market conditions it would be appropriate to consider lowering the policy rate moving it closer to a neutral setting at this point we have not seen significant economic impacts from trade developments or other factors and the u s economy has continued to be resilient despite some slowing in economic growth private domestic final purchases pdfp growth slowed to a moderate pace in the first quarter even as activity was partly boosted by a pull forward of spending on motor vehicles and high tech equipment ahead of the implementation of tariffs although the pull forward of spending appears to be unwinding retail and motor vehicle sales through may provide further evidence that pdfp has softened so far this year the labor market appears to remain solid with payroll employment rising about per month on average in april and may only slightly below the average monthly gains over the past two quarters this pace of job gains appears consistent with the unemployment rate remaining at a low percent through may which is roughly unchanged since the middle of last year the labor market appears to be stable near estimates of full employment with layoffs remaining low the number of job openings relative to job seekers has moved roughly sideways since the middle of last year at or a touch below the pre pandemic level and the labor market no longer appears to be especially tight or a significant source of inflation pressures as most wage growth measures have slowed closer to a pace consistent with percent inflation turning to inflation we have seen a welcome return to further moderation of personal consumption e penditures pce inflation over the past three months the may consumer and producer price reports suggest that month core pce inflation stood at percent in may down meaningfully from its elevated reading of percent at the end of last year similar to the past two years elevated monthly inflation readings in january and february have been followed by low readings as we move into the spring on a month basis core pce goods inflation has picked up somewhat since last december but this has been more than offset by a considerable slowing in core pce services inflation it appears that any upward pressure from higher tariffs on goods prices is being offset by other factors and that the underlying trend in core pce inflation is moving much closer to our percent target than is currently apparent in the data with housing services inflation on a sustained downward trajectory and other core services inflation already consistent with percent inflation only core goods inflation remains somewhat elevated likely reflecting limited passthrough from tariffs with economic growth slowing it is possible that recent softness in aggregate demand could be starting to translate into weaker labor market conditions while still strong the labor market appears to be less dynamic with modest hiring rates layoffs edging up from low levels and job gains concentrated in just a few industries with inflation on a sustained trajectory toward percent softness in aggregate demand and signs of fragility in the labor market i think that we should put more weight on downside risks to our employment mandate going forward despite progress on lowering inflation there are potential upside risks if negotiations result in higher tariffs or if firms raise goods prices independent of any tariff pass through although we have not seen evidence of disruptive impacts on supply chains changes in global trade patterns could lead to an increase in prices for goods and services the current conflict in the middle east or other geopolitical tensions could also lead to higher commodity prices i am certainly attentive to these inflation risks but i am not yet seeing a major concern as some retailers seem unwilling to raise prices for essentials due to high price sensitivity among low income consumers and as supply chains appear to be largely unaffected so far measures of policy and economic uncertainty have receded from recent highs and measures of consumer and business sentiment have also improved in recent weeks after having dropped considerably these developments reinforce my view that concerns will subside as more clarity emerges on trade policy businesses appear to be resuming investment and hiring decisions as they feel increasingly confident that less favorable trade outcomes are unlikely to occur i remain focused on how new policies evolve and whether future data releases will provide perspective about their economic impacts on trade policy i e pect that negotiations will ultimately result in lower tariff rates than are currently in place consistent with the resumption of financial market optimism further should we see effects on inflation this year i e pect that increased slack in the economy will limit this to a small one off impact small and one off price increases this year should translate only into a small drag on real activity i also e pect that less restrictive regulations lower business ta es and a more friendly business environment will likely boost supply and largely offset any negative effects on economic activity and prices in considering the risks to achieving our dual mandate i fully supported the revised characterization of uncertainty and the balance of risks in our most recent monetary policy statement pointing to the diminished uncertainty and removing the emphasis on risks to both sides of our mandate in my view it was appropriate to recognize that the balance of risks has shifted in fact the data have not shown clear signs of material impacts from tariffs and other policies i think it is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially e pected especially because many firms front loaded their stocks of inventories and all considered ongoing progress on trade and tariff negotiations has led to an economic environment that is now demonstrably less risky the change in our monetary policy statement appropriately incorporates this shift in the balance of risks as well as the rapid improvement in many measures of uncertainty as we think about the path forward it is time to consider adjusting the policy rate as inflation has declined or come in below expectations over the past few months we should recognize that inflation appears to be on a sustained path toward percent and that there will likely be only minimal impacts on overall core pce inflation from changes to trade policy we should also recognize that downside risks to our employment mandate could soon become more salient given recent softness in spending and signs of fragility in the labor market before our next meeting in july we will have received one additional month of employment and inflation data if upcoming data show inflation continuing to evolve favorably with upward pressures remaining limited to goods prices or if we see signs that softer spending is spilling over into weaker labor market conditions such developments should be addressed in our policy discussions and reflected in our deliberations should inflation pressures remain contained i would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting in order to bring it closer to its neutral setting and to sustain a healthy labor market in the meantime i will continue to carefully monitor economic conditions as the administration s policies the economy and financial markets continue to evolve it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course at each fomc meeting my colleagues and i will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the fed s dual mandate goals of ma imum employment and stable prices i will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as i assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance bringing inflation in line with our price stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy labor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run policy shifts and unintended consequencesin my responsibilities over bank regulation and supervision at the federal reserve i intend to apply a pragmatic approach we will review data and evidence identify problems that need to be resolved and develop efficient solutions to address those identified issues while the regulatory authority of the federal reserve is primarily related to the banking system theconsequencesof banking regulation and supervisory efforts are not limited to the banking system bank regulation and supervision affect how financial activities are conducted the cost and availability of credit and financial services and even what types of entities provide those services while it is important to consider the consequences of regulatory actions as they evolve over time in cases where regulation may create or e acerbate financial stability risks we must e amine whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the regulation bank affiliated broker dealers play a critical role in u s capital markets including in treasury market intermediation activities today i will discuss the lessons we have learned about how bank regulatory requirements specifically leverage ratios in the united states can have unintended consequences leverage ratio impacts on bank affiliated broker dealers can have broader impacts including market impacts like those observed in treasury market intermediation activities once we ve identified emerging unintended consequencesâ issues that were not contemplated during the development of a regulatory approachâ we must consider how to revisit earlier regulatory and policy decisions as i will discuss in greater detail shortly regulators must act quickly to address the growing problems with increasingly binding leverage ratios in in connection with the e piration of temporary emergency changes to the supplementary leverage ratio slr the federal reserve committed to soon inviting public comment on potential modifications over four years later a proposal has not been issued and problems with treasury market intermediation continue to emerge the time has come for the federal banking agencies to revisit leverage ratios and their impacts on the treasury markets looking at the data treasury market functioningas a first step in this pragmatic approach it is important to look at what the data says about treasury market functioning this is a necessary first step before we determine whether there are issues or problems that can be addressed through adjustments to bank regulatory requirements a review of treasury market data provides a history of growing issues with treasury market functioning in recent years u s policy debates have highlighted the need to take preventative measures to ensure smooth market functioning one issue that continues to persist is low levels of treasury market liquidity as the board s semiannualfinancial stability reportnoted in addition some dealers e perienced balance sheet pressure in intermediating record volumes of treasury market transactions in the spring at a time when reports from market participants also indicated reduced demand from other treasury investors a survey of market participants from the fed s most recentfinancial stability reportnoted that more than a quarter of respondents cited treasury market functioning as a risk to the u s financial system and the broader global economy this was an increase from the same survey conducted last fall when percent of those surveyed cited treasury market functioning as a risk recent changes to treasury market clearing activities from the securities and e change commission s central clearing requirement for u s treasuries were implemented to improve treasury market functioning once fully implemented these changes may improve market functioning the federal reserve s standing repo facility may also help to promote smooth functioning in the treasury market but it is unclear how the ongoing increases in the volume of treasury issuance the volume of treasury securities outstanding and changes to the fed s balance sheet over time may also affect market liquidity treasury markets have e perienced stress events as recently as the september repo market stress and the so called dash for cash in march of in early april we also saw strains in treasury cash markets although markets continued to function there were une pected moves in treasury yields with an initial drop in yields followed by a sharp increase that seems to have been driven in part by the unwinding of the swap spread trade by leveraged investors in response to declining swap spreads we do not know e actly what circumstances may lead to a future stress event or how it will manifest and continuing to impose unwarranted limits on dealers intermediation capacity could e acerbate a future stress event in this critical market but we do know that these events have raised concerns about the resilience of u s treasury markets therefore we should continue to actively monitor indicators of market functioning recent trends in both market liquidity indicators and survey responses suggest that this problem has persisted and may be becoming more severe low liquidity can create more volatility in prices e acerbate the effects of market shocks and threaten market functioning identifying the problem looking beyond treasury market intermediationlarge bank affiliated primary dealers play a vital role in the intermediation of u s treasury markets these dealers are subject to not insulated from the effect of banking regulation while many factors can affect market liquidity including the growing volume of treasury issuance treasury market saturation and interest rate volatility we must consider whether some of the pressure is a byproduct of bank regulation due to the role of large banks in the intermediation of treasury markets there is a direct link between banking regulation and treasury market liquidity particularly when it comes to the growth of safe assets in the banking system and the increase in leverage based capital requirements becoming the binding capital constraint on some large banks in the federal reserve along with the office of the comptroller of the currency occ proposed significant changes to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio eslr that applies to the largest banks these revisions were never finalized but the intent behind them was to return the eslr to its traditional role as a backstop capital requirement instead of what has become a substantial balance sheet constraint the proposed change was designed to promote resilience in the banking system and to protect financial stability while also ma imizing credit availability and economic growth throughout the credit cycle during the covid pandemic the federal reserve addressed constraints on the ability of u s banks to support efficient treasury market functioning by temporarily e cluding fed reserves and treasuries from the denominator of the slr the central role of bank affiliated broker dealers in treasury market intermediation has led us to take a close look at bank regulatory requirements to clarify how these requirements particularly their calibration may impact treasury market functioning although designed to address low risk activities like treasury market intermediation leverage ratios have become increasingly binding as a bank capital constraint as market conditions change while issues around the use of leverage ratios require close e amination a solid capital foundation in the banking system is critical to support safety and soundness and financial stability revisiting the calibration of leverage ratios to ensure that they remain backstops instead of creating binding constraints especially in times of stress should not be interpreted as a critique of the role of capital in a robust regulatory and supervisory framework but to be clear theconsequencesof an overly restrictive leverage ratio go well beyond just treasury market intermediation and impact a wide range of low risk activities leverage capital requirements do not differentiate between the risk of different asset classes or e posures however in periods when bank balance sheets are e pandingâ like the significant deposit inflows during covid â leverage capital requirements can unintentionally become the binding constraint on both banks and their affiliates this increases the amount of required capital as bank balance sheets grow regardless of the underlying risk when constrained in this way bank affiliated primary dealers may pull back on the market intermediation of low risk assets like u s treasuries a binding leverage capital requirement can create perverse incentives for banks to shift their balance sheets into higher risk assets since doing so could generate larger returns without requiring additional capital this is simply a cause and effect of overly restrictive leverage capital the fact of leverage ratios becoming increasingly binding is evident in simple metrics like the ratio of risk weighted assets to total leverage e posure these are respectively the denominators of risk based capital ratios and the slr shortly after the slr was adopted in the u s in the mid s this ratio stood at percent in the aggregate for the eight largest u s banks the global systemically important banks g sibs since then the ratio of risk weighted assets to total leverage e posure has declined and currently stands at percent primarily due to higher reserves and other types of high quality liquid assets on bank balance sheets this downward trend results in the slr increasingly becoming the binding constraint and reflects banks growing holdings of high quality liquid assets most of which carry a risk weight of zero underrisk basedcapital ratios but have a percent weighting underleveragecapital ratios efficient solutionsone e ample of the slr s unintended consequence is the erosion of liquidity in u s treasury markets because it is driven in part by leverage ratio requirements increasingly becoming the binding constraints on the largest u s banks this e ample also illustrates the necessity of evaluating tradeoffs in regulation and speaks to a larger issue with the calibration of leverage the banking regulators are uniquely positioned to both analyze and remediate components of the bank regulatory framework that may disrupt banks participation in low risk but economically critical activities this includes the e acerbation of treasury market illiquidity treasury markets play a critical role in the u s and global financial systems and we should be proactive in addressing the unintended consequences of bank regulation while ensuring the framework continues to promote safety soundness and financial stability we should start by addressing potential constraints on treasury market functioning before issues arise lessening impacts from stress and mitigating the need to intervene in future market events on wednesday the board is scheduled to consider specific amendments to the eslr which is the requirement that applies at both the holding company and bank levels of the largest u s banks while i do not want to front run the proposal i will note that the proposal s goal is to address a long identifiedâ and growingâ problem with the calibration of this leverage requirement the proposal would solicit public comment on the impacts of this miscalibration potential fi es and work to develop an appropriate and effective solution this proposal takes a first step toward what i view as long overdue follow up to review and reform what have become distorted capital requirements this proposal while meaningful addresses only one element of the capital framework more work on capital requirements remains especially to consider how they have evolved and whether changes in market conditions have revealed issues that should be addressed in a few weeks on july the federal reserve will host a conference to bring together a wide range of thought leaders to discuss the u s bank capital framework including the design and calibration of leverage ratios fi ing the design and calibration of leverage capital requirements will not resolve every issue with u s treasury market functioning but simple reforms to return leverage ratio requirements to their traditional role as a capital backstop could improve treasury market functioning by building resilience in advance of future stress events and this could reduce the chances that we would need to intervene in treasury markets should a future stress event arise while we know well the issues created by the eslr there are many potential improvements that could address other issues within the capital framework as i have noted previously a broader set of reforms could include amending not only the leverage capital ratio but also g sib surcharge requirements we should also reconsider capital requirements for a wider range of banks including the slr s application to banks with more than billion in assets tier leverage requirements and the calibration of the community bank leverage ratio the unintended shift over time in the eslr increasingly becoming a binding capital constraint demonstrates that we need to think about regulatory policies in a dynamic way based on the evolution in the banking and financial systems and the broader economy other e amples of regulations that must take into account the impact of economic growth and inflation include elements of the g sib surcharge as well as regulatory thresholds that define the broader categories of banks thresholds like the billion definition of a community bank and the billion in total assets and billion for cross jurisdictional activity separating category ii and iii banks determine which regulatory requirements apply to each group one way to prevent the original calibration from becoming divorced from the foundational policy decisions over time is to inde the relevant g sib surcharge coefficients and regulatory thresholds to nominal gross domestic product while approaches like inde ing thresholds and requirements can make our regulations more robust and durable over time we should also acknowledge the essential role of supervision as a tool to promote safety and soundness and financial stability just as our capital requirements are intended to operate in a complementary manner so do regulation and supervision act in a complementary way these are only a handful of relevant e amples but they are representative of an effective approach to regulatory reform regulations should not be created in a static world of set it and forget it the economy evolves over time as do the banking and financial systems and the needs of businesses and consumers increasingly regulators are e pected to conduct a more thorough and detailed analysis as part of the ordinary rulemaking process which includes a proposal s costs and benefits yet over time we tend to devote fewer resources to the work of conducting maintenance of our regulations maintenance of the regulatory system should include reviewing the basis for earlier policy decisions considering whether the policies embedded in regulations have been distorted over time through market developments and e amining whether emerging issues in the market should lead to further review and revision closing thoughtsthank you for the opportunity to join you today and to provide my views on the u s economic outlook and current regulatory proposals in the united states regulatory policy objectives are prescribed by law and bank regulators focus primarily on promoting the safe and sound operation of u s banks and financial stability despite this limited purpose we must understand the consequences of regulations which can e tend well beyond the banking system recent trendsâ including providing more fact based and analytical support for proposalsâ are a positive step in achieving responsible regulation but we need a broad commitment to follow the approach i have just described we must consider relevant data and information identify the source of any problems or opportunity for greater efficiency and then develop targeted and effective policy solutions and approaches the views e pressed here are my own and are not necessarily

the international journal of central banking prague czech republic thank you aleå and thank you to the czech national bank cnb for hosting this year s conference the cnb also supported this conference in it is wonderful to have such a great relationship between theinternational journal of central banking ijcb and one of our sponsoring institutions i would like to take a few minutes as the outgoing managing editor of the ijcb to emphasize the importance of this journal and the research it supports central banks play an important role promoting the growth and effective functioning of their economies and many of the decisions they make are influenced by careful and cutting edge research in fact i recently gave a speech that discussed the importance of economic research in monetary policy decisions the ijcb through this conference and its volumes provides an outlet to share and disseminate research that adds to public knowledge and understanding and informs the operational and policy decisions of central bankers the value of central bankâ focused research has long been known in the summer of the bank for international settlements bis the european central bank and the group of ten central banks agreed to support the development of the ijcb to focus on the theory and practice of central banking the journal has attracted distinguished managing editors including my colleagues from the federal reserve my immediate predecessor luc laeven from the european central bank and the current managing editor antoine martin from the swiss national bank who unfortunately could not be here today we have the strong support now of nearly sponsoring institutions including the czech national bank and also the host of last year s conference the central bank of italy among the ways that central banks serve the public interest is as an ongoing source of economic research and the strong commitment to the ijcb here in prague and other capitals advances our collective interest in strong economies and financial stability turning to this year s conference we chose the theme based on events that have been very much on the minds of central bankers assessing the effectiveness of monetary policy during and after the covid pandemic the past several years have seen significant monetary policy actions across the globe in response to covidâ â induced recessions inflation higher than in several decades unprecedented supply chain disruptions and in some countries very tight labor markets early on policymakers responses appeared quite in sync but with differing speeds of recovery and varying challenges faced by different types of economies that changed over time additionally geopolitical tensions and energy price shocks have introduced new comple ities so we thought this conference could be a good place to come together and hear about the lessons we have learned from these common and different e periences today and tomorrow we will be discussing the yield curve policy rules and monetary policy transmission we also will look into banking issues such as loan issuance and financial stability and we are lucky to have the fed s vice chair for supervision miki bowman here to give a keynote speech as we go through these sessions i hope we will all ask ourselves how this work can help policymakers do their jobs better through our conversation i would ask you to share knowledge about each of these topics as they are pertinent around the world but before we get to those presentations and what i hope will be vigorous discussion let me recognize several people who made this event possible here at the cnb simona malovaná and martin hodula helped organize this conference year round the ijcb co editors devote many hours of their time to review papers to keep

ible and stable monetary and financial system vice chair for supervision michelle w bowman at the georgetown university mcdonough school of business psaros center for financial markets and policy washington d c it is a pleasure to join you today for my first public remarks as the federal reserve board s vice chair for supervision today i will describe my approach to leading the fed s division of supervision and regulation in its vital work to promote the safe and sound operation of the u s banking system i have spoken e tensively in the past about my principles for supervision and regulation which will continue to guide my approach to supervision and the bank regulatory framework at the core of these principles is pragmatism which focuses on first identifying the problem to be solved and then developing efficient solutions once we have identified a need for reform or a problem to be solved our next task is to conduct a careful analysis of the intended and unintended consequences of any proposed policy solution and to consider alternative approaches that lead to lower cost or better outcomes the views i share with you today reflect my initial thoughts about how these principles should be incorporated into the important work that will be required to improve supervision and regulation in the future addressing i enhancing supervision to more effectively and efficiently meet the fed s safety and soundness goals ii reviewing and reforming the capital framework to ensure that it is appropriately designed and calibrated iii reviewing regulations and information collections to ensure that this framework remains viable and iv considering approaches to ensure the applications process is transparent predictable and fair enhancing supervisionsupervision focused on material financial risks that threaten a bank s safety and soundness is inherently more effective and efficient we should be cautious about the temptation to overemphasize or become distracted by relatively less important procedural and documentation shortcomings fundamentally as i ve noted in the past our goal should be to prioritize the identification of material financial risks and encourage prompt action to mitigate risks that threaten safety and soundness there are a number of changes we can adopt in the near term to better enable us to accomplish this goal tailoring risks are not uniform and each bank is unique based on its business model comple ity and business profile i am a long time proponent of tailoring banking regulations going forward we will e tend the application of tailoring to our supervisory approach to financial institutions not only among bank categories but also within a particular category in the past the board has pushed down requirements developed for the largest firms to smaller banks often including regional and community banks one approach that would preserve tailoring is to create an independent community bank supervisory and regulatory framework to clearly separate these banks from larger bank supervision and regulation this would serve to insulate these smaller banks from standards designed for larger and more comple firms while i have no objection to a deliberate intentional policy to apply similar standards to firms with similar characteristics as conditions warrant the gradual erosion of distinct regulatory and supervisory standards among firms with very different characteristicsâ essentially the subtle reversal of tailoring over timeâ is not a reasonable approach for implementing supervision and regulation both regulators and legislators should consider whether the bank regulatory framework includes appropriate thresholds for defining distinct categories of institutions and whether simple fi esâ for e ample the inde ing of thresholds to inflation or growthâ could better ensure a sound tailored approach that remains durable over time it is clear that the current billion threshold defining the upper bounds of a community bank leaves many institutions that pursue this business modelâ of community and relationship based bankingâ subject to heightened requirements more suitable for larger and more comple firms to further these objectives later this year i will host a conference on small and community bank issues to discuss improving the bank regulatory framework to adopt a more efficient tailored approach for these firms we must demonstrate wisdom and courage by carefully listening to those who are subject to regulatory oversight and considering ways to enhance our approaches to both supervision and regulation one issue that continues to present challenges to smaller banks is check fraud the ongoing increase in bank losses to this type of fraud can negatively impact the perceived safety of the banking system and result in significant consumer harm past efforts by regulators have been frustratingly slow to advance and seem to have done little to address the underlying root causes of this increase in fraud i will continue to work to identify specific actions that can be taken to reduce the incidence of fraud including through e pediting the remediation process from check fraud after it occurs i e pect that the federal reserve in coordination with the occ and fdic will soon take action on this front ratings ratings must reflect risk and yet we have seen gradual changes in supervisory approaches that have eroded the link between ratings and financial condition federal reserve supervisory statistics show that that two thirds of the largest financial institutions in the u s were rated unsatisfactory in the first half of at the same time the majority of these same institutions met all supervisory expectations for capital and liquidity this odd mismatch between financial condition and supervisory ratings requires careful review and appropriate revisions to our current approach under the current large bank ratings framework a single component rating can result in a firm being considered not well managed which has driven the disparity between well managed status and financial condition the federal reserve will soon begin to address this mismatch by proposing changes to the large financial institution ratings framework the proposed changes will be designed to result in a more sensible approach to determining whether a firm is well managed no longer disproportionately weighting a single framework component for a firm that has demonstrated resilience under a range of conditions and stresses this initial change should help address the gap between assessed ratings and material financial risk for those firms subject to this framework we have an obligation to ensure that our supervisory ratings are current credible and reflect material financial risk this promotes effective supervision and ensures that firms are accurately rated based on their underlying financial strength which should increase the public s confidence in our assessment of the banking system we must also consider the appropriateness of the broader ratings framework which applies to smaller institutions including the camels framework are these frameworks appropriately tailored to capture material financial risks particularly for elements that rely on subjective e aminer judgment while judgment is a legitimate and necessary tool in supervision it must always be grounded in the materiality of the identified issues as they relate to the financial health of each institution and the banking system as a whole this has been a notable shift in supervision not only for large banks but also for regional and community banks improving prioritization e aminers review a broad range of activities in the supervisory process a random sample of e amination reports demonstrates that supervisory focus has shifted away from core financial risks credit risk interest rate risk and liquidity risk for e ample to process related concerns while process is important for effective management there is a risk that overemphasis on process and supervisory bo checking can be a distraction from the core purpose of supervision which is to probe financial condition and financial risk checklists should not distract e aminers from the central purpose of e aminations another tool that we will be reviewing with a critical lens is the use of horizontal reviews in theory horizontal reviewsâ where e aminers conduct a narrow but deep review on a particular topic across multiple banksâ can help improve an e aminer s perspective horizontal reviews when used effectively can help supervisors better understand the range of industry practices but these reviews have quickly evolved into oversimplification of comple issues and often include grading on a curve where firms are rank ordered with an e pectation that implementing a simpler approach fails to meet expectations under the assumption that the more comple approach is appropriate for all firms however this side by side comparison fails to address the only question that matters whether a firm s approach meets appropriate legal and supervisory standards for the individual firm s characteristics differences in approaches are not indicative of shortcomings particularly since these can often be e plained by distinguishing the underlying activities scope and scale of operations and risk tolerance of the firm s board and management there is also a lack of transparency in the results of these e ams and a risk that horizontal reviews will create generally applicable rules without complying with the administrative procedure act apa i will be looking closely at whether the continued use of horizontal e ams going forward is appropriate and if so to ensure that these e ams are sufficiently transparent they reflect proper respect for the apa and do not circumvent our responsibility to provide each regulated institution with a fair firm specific evaluation the role of guidance in supervision finally i will discuss the important role of guidance in the supervisory process guidance can be an effective tool to promote transparency in supervisory expectations to provide clarity to regulated institutions on the permissibility of new activities and their associated risks and to provide firms some perspective on how they may comply with statutory and regulatory requirements structured with these goals in mind guidance can further the objective of supervisory prioritization where guidance does not further these objectives it is worth revisiting i think it is important that we review a wide range of existing guidance including outstanding supervision and regulation letters sr letters topical guidance that addresses issues that may adversely affect innovation like the extensive guidance that has some bearing on third party risk management and the many other guidance documents that have been issued in recent years fundamentally guidance should clarify expectations and provide answers to industry questions such as our earlier office hours guidance that provided a venue for banks and innovators to share information on new products and services like digital asset activities and artificial intelligence changing expectations around the use of guidance as a tool to promote clarity in supervisory expectations can encourage innovation in the banking system uncertainty in supervisory expectations has long been an obstacle to banks seeking to innovate including banks engaging in digital asset activities or incorporating new technologies like artificial intelligence to improve efficiency and delivery of products and services just as it is imperative that banks innovate to remain competitive in the future it is critical that bank supervisors enable the adoption of new technologies in a manner consistent with safety and soundness e aminer training and workforce development e aminers must engage in a challenging course of study and pass rigorous tests before qualifying to become a commissioned bank e aminer those who have obtained this license have a strong foundation that they can rely on to conduct appropriate e aminations the commission demonstrates an elevated level of e pertise judgment and fairness that these e aminers bring to their work as such they should not shy away from transparency or public accountability currently the federal reserve does not require all staff involved in supervision and bank e amination to have met or to be on a path to meet this credential regulated entities should be able to e pect that all of our e amination and supervisory teams have achieved or are working to achieve this level of professional e pertise going forward the fed will prioritize this training particularly as we face an aging workforce across the federal banking agencies that will require our new e amination staff to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system into the future failure to invest in and plan for e aminer training today will result in much less effective supervision in years to come capitalcapital requirements are an important component of the prudential regulatory framework and are essential for the stability of interconnected banking and financial systems around the world yet too often our efforts to address capital reform take a piecemeal approach to capital requirements we tend to review individual elements of the capital framework in isolation without considering whether proposed changes are sensible in the aggregate and contribute to a capital framework in which all components work together effectively while each component is important the aggregate calibration of requirements is ultimately the most meaningful and we must e amine whether this approach in totality appropriately captures risk over calibrated capital requirements effectively create market distortions disfavoring some activities over others in a way that is divorced from prudential safety and soundness goals and economic conditions leverage ratios are one e ample that illustrates this concern the federal reserve has long acknowledged that leverage ratios are intended to act as a backstop to risk based capital requirements when leverage ratios become the binding capital constraint at an e cessive level they can create market distortions this is especially true in the case of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio eslr which is applicable to the largest banks as a result of this leverage requirement banks are less inclined to engage in low risk activities like treasury market intermediation and revise their business activities in a way that is neither justified nor responsive to their customer needs these distortions can also create broader financial system impacts like increased stress on treasury market functioning to be clear the increasing bindingness of the eslr on the largest firms did not result from careful policy debate and discussion instead it is an unintended consequence of market and other bank regulatory requirements implemented after it was originally put in place the original calibration of the eslr was based on forecasts of the level of reserves and other so called safe assets in the system that are now far out of line with current levels i e pect that in the near future the agencies will publish a proposal to help address this concern and ensure that the eslr resumes functioning as a backstop capital requirement while this fi to the eslr is necessary it may not be sufficient to address issues in the capital framework in july the federal reserve will host a conference that will broaden our perspective in the consideration of capital requirements for large banks we will bring together bankers academics and other capital experts to e amine whether capital requirements as currently structured and calibrated are operating as intendedâ in a complementary fashion i welcome the opportunity to consider a broader range of perspectives as we look to the future of capital framework reforms in addition to considering potential changes to leverage ratio requirements and stress testing the capital conference will also include a discussion of potential reforms to the gsib surcharge and the basel iii capital requirements the board has already proposed a significant change to reduce the volatility in capital requirements resulting from our current stress testing process the proposal includes providing a longer implementation timeline to phase in the annual stress capital buffer requirement and later this year the board will consider more extensive changes aimed at promoting transparency fairness and predictability in the stress testing program while stress testing is an important supervisory tool its implementation outcomes and processes have raised significant questions and concerns about its effectiveness in identifying systemic weakness the lack of transparency around the models used in stress testing prevents meaningful discussions about how the stress tests can be improved capital has an impact on the business activities of all banks although the capital framework for the smallest institutions tends to be simpler and more straightforward calibration and design elements play an important role in the functioning of smaller banks just as they do for larger banks therefore it is important that we also take the opportunity to address issues for smaller banks that provide critical support to their local communities and the economy on this front we will review and consider the community bank framework including capital requirements like the calibration of the community bank leverage ratio and whether reforms to the capital framework for mutual banks can be improved to promote capital formation i look forward to the results of public engagement on these issues including through the upcoming conferences as we consider bank capital requirements the focus should be on achieving a capital framework that provides a strong foundation for the banking system appropriately requires banks to hold capital corresponding to risk and works together with bank supervision to support a safe and sound banking system review of regulations and information collectionssince the passage of the dodd frank act nearly years ago the body of regulations that all banks are subject to has increased dramatically many of the reforms made after the financial crisis were important and essential to ensuring a stronger and more resilient banking system yet a number of the changes were backward lookingâ responding only to that mortgage crisisâ not fully considering the potential future unintended consequences or future states of the world with well over a decade of change in the banking system now behind us post implementation it is time to evaluate whether all of these changes continue to be relevant some of the regulations put in place immediately after that financial crisis resulted in pushing foundational banking activities out of the regulated banking system into the less regulated corners of the financial system we need to ask whether this was and continues to be appropriate these tradeoffs are complicated and we must consider not only the changes that were made but also the evolution of and differences in the banking system today driving all risk out of the banking system is at odds with the fundamental nature of the business of banking banks must be able to earn a profit and grow while also managing their risks adding requirements that impose more costs must be balanced with whether the new requirements make the correct tradeoffs between safety and soundness and enabling banks to serve their customers and run their businesses the task of policymakers and regulators isnotto eliminate risk from the banking system but rather to ensure that risk is appropriately and effectively managed in a well functioning regulated banking system banks serve an indispensable role in credit provision and economic stability the goal is to create and maintain a system that supports safe and sound banking practices and results in the implementation of proper risk management our goal should not be to prevent banks from failing or even eliminate the risk that they will our goal should be to make banks safe to fail meaning that they can be allowed to fail without threatening to destabilize the rest of the banking system maintenance of the regulatory framework is necessary to ensure that our regulations continue to strike the right balance between encouraging growth and innovation and safety and soundness one easily identifiable way to achieve this is using the economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act egrpra review process which the agencies initiated in february of last year the egrpra review process requires the federal banking agencies to identify any outdated unnecessary or overly burdensome regulations eliminate unnecessary regulations and take other steps to address the regulatory burdens associated with outdated or overly burdensome regulations prior iterations of the egrpra process have been underwhelming in their ability to result in meaningful change but it is my e pectation that this review and eventually the accompanying report to congress will provide a meaningful process for stakeholders and the public to engage with the banking agencies in identifying regulations that are no longer necessary or are overly burdensome it is also my e pectation that regulators will be responsive to concerns raised by the public another area that is ripe for review are several of the board s rules that address core banking issuesâ from loans to insiders to transactions with affiliates to state member bank activities and domestic and foreign activities of bank holding companies many of the board s regulations have not been comprehensively reviewed or updated in more than years given the dynamic nature of the banking system and how the economy and banking and financial services industries have evolved over that period we should update and simplify many of the board s regulations including thresholds for applicability and benchmarks banking applicationsthe process to file an application and receive regulatory approval whether it involves banks seeking ade novocharter institutions seeking to merge or any other application for bank regulatory approval should reflect both transparency as to the information required in the application itself and the standards of approval being applied and clear timelines for action recent e perience with banking applications suggests that revisions would be helpful in this space streamlining the applications forde novoformation and establishing clearer standards for approval may encourage morede novoactivity similar problems have affected bank mergers and acquisitions where there have been lengthy processing delays we need to rethink whether many of the additional requests for information can be addressed through better application forms or relying on information that is available from bank e aminations we should also consider factors that force applications to be moved from reserve bank delegated processing to requiring consideration by the board one e ample is the perverse effect of competitive screens that disproportionately affect transactions in rural and underserved banking markets another is the treatment of adverse public comments that may lack factual support or rely on matters already considered in the review process including existing supervisory records closing thoughtsi am honored to have the opportunity to serve as the vice chair for supervision the work of supervision and regulation is critical to maintaining a safe and sound banking system and protecting u s financial stability conditions constantly evolve in the banking system and so too must the regulatory and supervisory framework we must be proactive and responsive in the face of emerging risks and ensure that the framework operates in an efficient and effective manner the steps i have identified today are intended to further these goals by creating an initial roadmap to refocus supervisory and regulatory efforts on the core financial risks most critical to maintaining a healthy and resilient banking system i look forward to working with

ible and stable monetary and financial system at the economic club of new york new york new york thank you barbara and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today it is an honor to join other members of the federal open market committee fomc who have addressed the economic club of new york over the years my subject is the current state of the u s economy the economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy the short version is that the labor market appears resilient and stable and economic activity is continuing to grow although at a more moderate pace than in the second half of last year while the labor market is currently at or near the fomc s goal of ma imum employment there is the prospect that trade and other policy changes could raise the unemployment rate and push employment away from our objective these policies especially higher import tariffs could also raise inflation over the rest of this year in fact while progress toward the fomc s goal of percent inflation has continued we have seen an escalation in goods inflation and data from surveys and non traditional sources point to some inflationary pressures as well in addition to increases in u s import tariffs and retaliatory increases in the tariffs foreign countries apply to u s e ports other policy changes either proposed or already underway relate to immigration fiscal policy and regulation those policies could affect economic conditions and since it is the fomc s job to set monetary policy that is best able to achieve our mandated goals of ma imum employment and stable prices we must consider the effects of these policies so far we are beginning to see the impact only of higher tariffs on inflation still thinking about the outlook requires consideration of how the economy could be affected by all these policy changes moving forward it remains difficult to judge the current strength of economic activity based on data through the first four months of primarily because of the front loading of imports ahead of the implementation of tariffs while real gross domestic product gdp declined slightly in the first quarter that was largely because of a surge in imports ahead of anticipated tariff increases a surge that will likely reverse putting aside fluctuations in trade and in inventories and focusing on the april data personal income and consumption point to a slight moderation in economic activity while personal disposable income increased at a healthy pace so far this year consumption grew more slowly in april which may indicate consumers are becoming more cautious that said there is considerable uncertainty about imports in the second quarter and uncertainty about the impact that higher prices will have on spending so i will be looking for more evidence about economic activity in may ahead of the fomc s next meeting june and one encouraging sign about economic activity is the resilience of the labor market we will get the may employment report tomorrow but the data in hand indicate that employment has continued to grow and that labor supply and demand remain in relative balance in april employers added jobs slightly higher than the average for the previous si months the unemployment rate was steady in april at percent in the historically low range of percent to percent that it has remained in since may data on job openings and quits for april likewise point to a resilient but somewhat looser labor market with a balance of supply and demand the vacancy rate a measure of demand for workers was percent down from a peak of percent three years ago and roughly the same level as just before the pandemic the quits rate an indicator of the confidence workers feel in finding a job has been in the narrow range of to percent since december and just a bit below the average level in ahead of tomorrow s employment report other data that we have for may are generally consistent with this picture of the labor market but may suggest some cooling the average of private sector forecasters predictions for total job creation is also while the pace of job layoffs remained at historically low levels through the final week of may based on the number of new claims for unemployment benefits other measures suggest modest increases in layoffs for instance worker adjustment and retraining notifications warn notices of layoffs have ticked up since the beginning of the year as have the mentions of layoffs in the fed s beige book survey and job cuts data reported by challenger gray and christmas the other side of the fomc s dual mandate is price stability progress in lowering inflation toward the committee s percent target has slowed some since last summer even if headline and core inflation have continued to decline the fomc s preferred inflation gauge based on personal consumption e penditures pce grew at a percent annual rate in april while that is quite close to the fomc s target it was dragged down by a decline in energy prices core inflationâ which e cludes volatile prices for food and energy and is a good guide to future inflationâ came in at percent so i do believe that our monetary policy stance which i view as modestly restrictive is currently appropriate to achieve and sustain percent inflation over the longer term sticking with core inflation to help me judge ongoing progress toward price stability i like to look at the month change in each of the three main categories of core inflation housing services services e cluding housing and goods the pce price inde for housing services has declined markedly in the past year from percent in april to percent in april this year but it is still considerably above the level that persisted before the pandemic meanwhile the pce price inde for core services e cluding housing which makes up more than half of core pce inflation has declined from percent in april last year to percent in april still somewhat above the level that prevailed before the pandemic and the third category is core goods inflation which rose at a percent annual rate in the months through april compared with april when it had actually fallen percent over the previous months in recent decades core goods prices have typically fallen over time helping to keep a lid on overall inflation so this is a meaningful reversal of the disinflationary process to sum up while core services inflation has fallen it is still running above the rate before the pandemic and the progress on core goods inflation has reversed i have been paying attention to this reversal for some time and how this could be e acerbated by the announced and implemented tariffs research published recently by federal reserve board staff calculates the pass through of tariffs enacted before april to individual product categories tracked in personal consumption e penditures using pce data from february through april the authors estimate that the percentage point increase in tariffs on chinese imports earlier in the year raised overall core pce prices by two tenths of percent since tariffs on china are currently higher than percent and tariffs have increased for other countries these results tell me first that the pass through of tariffs into prices is relatively quick and second should elevated tariffs persist even just in the short run larger effects may be coming soon the import surge i mentioned earlier ahead of sharp tariff increases has delayed the price effects associated with those tariffs and the reversal in that surge that i e pect in the next few months will likely signal larger price increases an important feature of most of the data i have mentioned so far is that it is released with significant lags for e ample the initial estimate of gdp is released about days after the end of the quarter and two later revisions mean that we may not get a clear idea of how output increased until nearly three months afterward monthly data on job openings are typically released with a one month delay the reasons for these lags are well known for instance statistical agencies can only survey households and businesses every so often and it takes time to compile and publish high quality statistics still if policymakers solely rely on these traditional data to forecast what the economy will do in the future they end up focusing on the past which is a little like driving down the road by looking in a rearview mirror as i mentioned in my speech last year to the national association for business economics there has been an e plosion of nontraditional or soft data produced by the private sector giving us an opportunity to measure economic developments with greater timeliness sometimes even in real time at a higher frequency and with more granularity these data are released closer to the time of collection such as several surveys from the federal reserve banks given today s fast changing and uncertain environment soft and non traditional data becomes all the more important that said nontraditional data often face their own challenges including issues with representativeness the lack of methodological consistency and a short time series history and to be clear while some non traditional data are indeed soft data in that they capture sentiment or expectations other data in this category are decidedly hard since they are based on actual decisions and actions by businesses and households in evaluating both traditional and nontraditional data on the economy i face a tradeoff between timeliness and precision but both sources are essential for me in formulating an outlook so in the conte t of hard data that has lately been providing a less than clear view of the economy what are the nontraditional data telling me about meeting the fomc s two economic objectives on the price stability side survey data from businesses suggest that price increases are coming these surveys report diffusion inde es which are calculated as the percentage of total respondents reporting increases in prices minus the percentage reporting declines surveys for may point to inde es for inputs and selling prices being elevated relative to the beginning of the year probably reflecting effects from higher tariffs manufacturing and non manufacturing surveys from the institute for supply management ism as well as several surveys from the federal reserve banks report increases in material prices and prices charged to customers with many respondents volunteering that this is related to tariff increases i believe expectations of future inflation are an important determinant of current inflation and data for may continue to point to increases in measures of near term inflation expectations an average of private sector economists published by the survey of professional forecasters finds that expectations for core pce inflation over the next year moved up from percent in april to percent in may among data on inflation expectations the most dramatic increases have been seen in the university of michigan surveys of consumers while i take seriously the concern that recent methodological changes in the survey may have made this measure less reliable this survey is a longstanding and important barometer of consumer sentiment and i still monitor the signals it is giving us closely according to the michigan survey consumers e pect inflation in the next year to average percent and over the next to years to average percent tariffs continued to be an important issue in the michigan survey with nearly three quarters of consumers mentioning them up from almost percent in april firms have also raised their inflation expectations with a survey by the cleveland fed reporting an increase in one year ahead expectations from percent in the first quarter to percent in the second however i still see stability in most measures of longer run inflation expectations notably expectations among professional forecasters for inflation to years ahead decreased from percent in april to percent in may that provides me some comfort as it points to confidence from the public in the fed to bring inflation to our goal of percent over the medium term recent developments and the data i have been monitoring have led me to consider at least three channels through which tariffs could have a persistent influence on inflation first as i have mentioned in some previous speeches while it is true that short run inflation expectations are influenced by short term economic shocks i value them because they often represent the horizon of decisionmaking for businesses and consumers the increase in short run inflation expectations that i previously mentioned may give businesses more leeway to raise prices thus increasing the persistence of inflation a second channel for tariffs influencing inflation could be opportunistic pricing by firms if they take advantage to increase prices of items not directly affected by tariffs this along with tariffs on intermediate goods could generate second round effects on inflation and a third channel is that lower productivity may lead to upward pressure on prices as firms adjust to the higher input costs and lower demand they may cut back on capital investment and shift to a less efficient combination of inputs while so far i have only seen anecdotal evidence for the opportunistic pricing among these three channels i am closely monitoring any signs of increased persistence on inflation nontraditional data indicators of real activity suggest that the economy might be starting to slow measures of household sentiment about economic conditions remain downbeat such as those from the university of michigan or the conference board as for businesses manufacturing surveys such as the ism report a slowing in new orders additionally the may beige book reports that economic activity has declined slightly relative to april on the services side representing the majority of businesses the ism pmi has trended down in the past few months and reached a level in may consistent with stagnation focusing on the ism services new order component it declined significantly in may to one of its lowest levels in recent years in summary the nontraditional data on economic activity are consistent with my overall assessment that we might be seeing some moderation in the growth of economic activity but not yet a significant slowdown as policies on fiscal matters and immigration take shape i find it important to also account for their implications for the u s economic outlook on the fiscal side the omnibus bill passed by the house would add stimulus to the economy on the immigration side we have seen inflows substantially down since last year which decreases the labor supply and could add meaningful upward pressure to inflation by the end of the year in sectors reliant on immigrant labor such as agriculture construction food processing and leisure and hospitality that said i have not yet seen much of an imprint on wages from these developments let me conclude with the implications of all this for monetary policy as inflation has declined over the past two years due in part to tighter monetary policy the u s economy has remained resilient with stable labor markets and employment near its ma imum sustainable level disinflation has slowed and we are already seeing the effects of higher tariffs which i e pect will continue to raise inflation over i see greater upside risks to inflation at this juncture and potential downside risks to employment and output growth down the road and this leads me to continue to support maintaining the fomc s policy rate at its current setting if upside risks to inflation remain i view our current stance of monetary policy as well positioned for any changes in the macroeconomic environment thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today and i look forward to what i e pect will be

change us president donald trump has spent months attacking the head of the us central bank on social media and in remarks to reporters calling federal reserve chairman jerome powell names like numbskull on thursday the dispute played out in person with cameras rolling as the two men clashed over the cost of building renovations the tense moment came as trump has been escalating his pressure on powell who trump says is moving too slowly to cut interest rates he has repeatedly floated the possibility of firing powell only to quickly disavow the idea which analysts say would rock financial markets and spark a legal battle trump s visit to the federal reserve is the first by a sitting president in roughly two decades it comes ahead of the fed s meeting in washington next week where policymakers are widely e pected to vote to leave interest rates unchanged speaking to reporters at the start of his tour trump said that the administration was taking a look at what s happening at the fed s bn bn renovation it looks like it s about bn trump said as powell shook his head i m not aware of that powell shot back i haven t heard that from anybody at the fed trump then produced a document from his jacket pocket which powell briefly read and brusquely handed back to the president saying that trump was adding a third building to the total it s a building that s being built trump said powell responded it s a building that was built five years ago it s not new project costs for renovating the eccles building and the constitution avenue building have risen from bn in to bn in according to the fed board s budget for this year however the increased funding has been met by the budgets from other building renovation projects being lowered and reallocated trump discussed firing fed boss but highly unlikely he will why trump keeps attacking the us central bank trump was asked by a reporter what he as a real estate developer would do with a project manager who was over budget generally speaking i d fire him he responded after his visit to the federal reserve trump wrote on social media that construction has got a long way to go would have been much better if it were never started but it is what it is he said the cost overruns are substantial but said the us can afford just about anything let s just get it finished and even more importantly lower interest rates trump said under us law governors of the central bank can only be removed for cause typically understood to be major misconduct the protection was intended to help insulate the bank from political pressure and ensure its leaders set policy in the best interests of the economy legal experts have said cost overruns on the construction project would not typically meet that bar during the visit trump was asked whether powell could say anything that could prompt him to back away from criticism he said that he would love to lower interest rates still white house officials and trump allies have honed in on the renovation issue the renovation project under attack was first approved in and was intended to allow the bank to consolidate its operations it involves two buildings from the s the fed has blamed the cost overruns on issues such as finding more asbestos than e pected and disputed white house characterisations of other aspects of the project such as whether it involves a vip elevator trump who has alternately referred to powell as a stubborn mule and trump hater told reporters this month that he believed mismanagement of the plan was sort of a fireable offence getty images the renovation project at the fed was first approved in trump nominated powell for his role as fed chair during his first presidential term in president joe biden renominated powell his term as chairman is set to end in may democrats have accused trump of trying to use his attacks on powell to distract and deflect as he faces pressure from his support base over his handling of jeffrey epstein files they have also argued he is setting up powell to be the scapegoat should the us economy weaken typically the fed lowers rates when the economy is in trouble hoping that by making it easier to borrow it will boost economic activity and keep employment stable it raises interest rates when it is worried about inflation aiming to slow activity and ease pressures pushing up prices economists say trump s radical changes to economic policy including higher tariffs ta cuts reductions in government spending and a crackdown on immigration have raised risks of both scenarios making it difficult to know what the bank should do powell has said he believes the economy is stable enough for the fed to wait to see what happens trump has said the bank should be cutting interest rates to reduce the us

artificial food colours are out so what s next hours ago share save suzanne bearne technology reporter share save fermentalg there are hundreds of thousands of microalgae species french firm fermentalg has been all over the planet in its search for useful microalgae one of our lucky scientists got to go and climb the volcanoes in the caribbean for e ample and i have to restrain myself from collecting more every time i go home to new zealand says hywel griffiths chief scientific officer at fermentalg there are hundreds of thousands of species of microalgae microscopic organisms which mostly live in water they are essential to the aquatic food chain and also produce half the o ygen we breathe some are already used commercially to make food animal feed and fertiliser but for fermantalg one particular type galdieria sulphuraria has a very useful trait it can be used to produce a pigment suitable for use in food called galdieria blue we grow the algae and make a lot of it under conditions which make a lot of this particular molecule the blue says mr griffiths the pigment can be used for any food and drinks and mr griffiths e pects the first products using galdieiria blue will be on shop shelves early next year galdieria blue was approved by the us food and drug administration fda in may along with butterfly pea flower e tract also a blue colour and calcium phosphate white the fda also approved gardenia blue earlier this month fermentalg fermentalg grows a microalgae that produces a blue molecule new sources of colour for food are needed as artificial food dyes are on their way out in january the fda announced the banning of red dye no in food products in addition the fda is looking to phase out petroleum based synthetic dyes such as yellow dye and by the end of next year as part of the government s mission to make america healthy again for the last years american children have increasingly been living in a to ic soup of synthetic chemicals fda commissioner marty makary said at a press conference in april is food colouring bad for you though not an outright ban the fda is hoping the food industry voluntarily complies to eliminate artificial food dyes by it comes after years of pressure from parents and campaigners for the fda to revoke approval for dyes or educate consumers more about the risks in recent times many us states have made their own moves to pass laws to remove artificial food colouring dyes countries differ on the restrictions they have in place historically the uk and the european union have been stricter than the us the eu has been phasing out artificial colourings over the last years and also introducing warnings on foods with other colours sensient sensient processes natural products and e tracts the colours so these are good times for firms developing natural alternatives us based sensient creates natural colours by sourcing raw materials that are grown specifically for their colour content for e ample some red and purple colours are derived from carrots and potatoes these crops are harvested washed processed into a juice and the colour is e tracted with water or other solvents says paul manning chief e ecutive officer at sensient the resulting colour is further processed to stabilise the concentrate and refine it to the specific shade desired by the customer but the hard work will be trying to match the synthetic colour it must be equally vivid says mr manning there are plenty of e amples of brands converting to natural colours with less vivid and vibrant shades where the product does poorly in the market and customers complain about both the colour and the flavour getting a stable bright colour also involved much work for fermantalg to our surprise we found that the process of growing the algae and the process of e tracting the colour can actually have a fairly significant impact on the stability of the product at the end even though it s fairly heavily purified says griffiths but something that we ve done upstream is having an impact on how stable it is at the end will these new colours cost more they are more e pensive but in actual contribution to the end product they re not actually that big an impact because these things are used at a fraction of a percentage in the final product says mr griffiths if you had a nosebleed and stood over the sink you know that a little bit of colour goes a long way sensient there s a rush to produce alternative food colours should we be letting flies eat our food waste why ukraine is one of the world s most digital countries from festivals to weddings why drone shows are booming for the brands that have long relied on artificial colourings it s an upheaval we are reformulating our cereals served in schools to not include fd c colours by the school year says a spokesperson for wk kellogg the company behind kellogg s fd c refers to certain certified synthetic colour additives regulated by the fda and approved by the federal food drug and cosmetic act last year protesters gathered outside the company headquarters in michigan calling on it to remove artificial dyes from cereals such as froot loops we will not be launching any new products with fd c colours beginning in january the spokesperson said this year food giants including nestle kraft heinz general mills and conagra have all pledged to phase out artificial food colourings one of the challenges for food brands reliant on artificial colouring is that many natural food dyes don t necessarily have a long shelf life says institute of food technologists food scientist renee leber whereas synthetic dyes will outlive the shelf life of pretty much any product she also says that as many brands rush to make the switch it s going to lead to a bottleneck in production we don t necessarily have all these colours available but we have months to get that right given this isn t an outright ban is it still e pected to lead to sweeping change in the us food industry if you are a cereal company and you have a brightly coloured cereal and all of your competitors switch from synthetics to natural colours then you don t necessarily want to be the last one

economies of both countries sir keir starmer and india s prime minister narendra modi together signed the agreement which the uk prime minister said was a landmark moment for both of our countries here s a quick guide to what s been agreed and what it could mean for you what has been agreed the uk has lowered ta es on goods imported from india including clothing and footwear food products including frozen prawns jewellery and gems some cars india has cut ta es on goods imported from the uk including cosmetics scotch whisky and gin soft drinks higher value cars food including lamb salmon chocolate and biscuits medical devices aerospace electrical machinery the deal will also allow british firms to compete for more services contracts in india starmer and modi sign bn india uk trade deal what will be the impact on people in the uk and india the trade deal won t come into force for up to a year so don t e pect to notice any immediate changes over time though the uk government says lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing jewellery and frozen prawns could lead to cheaper prices and more choice this deal could also be a big win for uk businesses which manufacture the goods which have seen tariffs slashed such as car makers and whisky distillers for e ample tariffs on whisky and gin being imported to india from the uk will be halved from to before reducing to by the th year of the deal getty images india s prime minister narendra modi and uk prime minister sir keir starmer car tariffs will fall from more than to that will provide a boost to those two industries as it will mean indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before if businesses end up e porting more goods to india and make higher profits this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff investing and also paying more ta in india consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the uk market which will boost their margins how important is this for the uk and india this deal has been a long time in the making with on off negotiations going on for some three years however it appears us president donald trump s introduction of tariffs on goods entering america has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free trade deals with one another the uk s deal with india is its third biggest after its agreements with australia and japan for conte t the uk has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about countries and one with the eu the eu is the biggest trade partner for both the uk and india therefore a free trade agreement between india and the eu would be more significant than the one with the uk both india and the eu have said they aim to finalise this by the end of last year trade between the uk and india totalled bn the uk government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional bn a year by in what it calls the impact assessment of the free trade agreement with india the government said that over time it will boost the uk economy by bn this is a tiny proportion of the uk economy which was worth trillion last year however india is also forecast to become the world s third largest economy in a few years it is also home to billion people about times the population of the uk which is a lot of potential customers the uk is also a high priority trading partner for india which has an ambitious target to grow e ports by tn bn by what does this mean for visas one of the reasons the uk india free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that india had made big demands about visas for indian professionals and students to work and study abroad the british government said it does not include any change in immigration policy including towards indian students studying in the uk but it does includes a three year e emption on the social security paid by indian employees working in the uk on short term visas they will only pay social security contributions in their home country this agreement known as the double contribution convention dcc is designed to ensure social security contributions are not made in more than one country the uk has similar reciprocal dcc agreements with other countries including the eu the us and south korea business secretary jonathan reynolds said it did not mean indian workers would be cheaper to hire than british staff there is no ta advantage for hiring an indian worker over a british worker he told

its relations with the eu i urged eu leaders to properly manage differences saying the current challenges facing europe do not come from china earlier in the year there were suggestions a trump presidency could help the eu and china find common cause but instead ties have grown more fraught the eu s member states are grappling with similar pressures to china not least the tariffs imposed on their e ports to the us but despite this expectations were low that anything significant would emerge from the summit which had been halved in length to just one day at beijing s request during a meeting in beijing s great hall of the people von der leyen and european council president antónio costa called for both sides to find real solutions it is vital for china and europe to acknowledge our respective concerns von der leyen said i called for mutual trust with eu countries at the meeting state news agency inhua reported boosting competitiveness does not come from building walls or barriers as decoupling and severing supply chains will only result in self isolation he said last year the eu recorded a bn bn bn trade deficit with china a number that has doubled in the past nine years the eu has criticised china for industrial overcapacity and imposed tariffs on chinese electric vehicles rebalancing will involve increasing market access for european companies in china reducing e port controls and limiting the impact of overcapacity von der leyen said china s foreign ministry said after the meeting that beijing was ready to work with relevant countries to enhance dialogue on e port controls von der leyen and costa also said they had pressed china to use its influence to persuade russia to end its war in ukraine how china continues to interact with putin s war will be a determining factor for our relations going forward von der leyen told a news conference at the end of the summit mood tense if not frosty shortly after arriving in beijing von der leyen described the summit as an opportunity for both sides to advance and rebalance their relationship i m convinced there can be a mutually beneficial co operation one that can define the next years of our relations she wrote on her words echoed the image of hope that both sides projected ahead of the summit eu officials had said that they were ready for frank conversations while chinese officials had framed it as a chance for greater collaboration china s foreign ministry said earlier in the week the bilateral relationship was at a critical juncture of building on past achievements and opening up a new chapter but i s decision to reject an invitation to brussels earlier this year and then to show up in moscow in may for russia s annual world war two victory parade made for a poor start engin eroglu who chairs the european parliament s china delegation believes that an already fragile trust between china and the eu has reached a new low in this atmosphere of strategic mistrust the mood is clearly tense if not frosty one of the main things that has led to the deterioration of relations between the two giants is the issue of the russia ukraine war the eu s decision to impose sanctions last week on two chinese banks for their role in supplying russia has annoyed beijing in the run up to this summit and made for an awkward climate china said it had lodged solemn representations to the eu s trade chief ahead of the summit and reports that chinese foreign minister wang yi told eu foreign policy chief kaja kallas this month that beijing did not want to see russia lose the war in ukraine contradicting china s official position of neutrality have also been circulating wang reportedly said that the russia ukraine war would keep the us distracted from its rivalry with china something beijing has denied kallas had earlier this year called china the key enabler of russia s war in ukraine adding that if china would want to really stop the support then it would have an impact getty images wang yi and kaja kallas met earlier this month in brussels trade relations have been central to the eu s concerns after the eu imposed tariffs on chinese made

city traders have rate rigging convictions quashed days ago share save andy verity rachel clun financial investigations correspondent business reporter bbc news share save tom hayes says it feels surreal to have his conviction quashed two former city traders who were at the centre of one of the biggest scandals of the financial crisis have had their convictions quashed following a year fight tom hayes and carlo palombo were jailed following trials for manipulating the interest rates used for loans between banks they were among city traders convicted in the us and uk for manipulating so called libor and euribor interest rates which are used to set borrowing costs on a range of loans such as mortgages and car finance deals following the ruling on wednesday mr hayes said the conviction had destroyed his family and that it felt surreal to be cleared the supreme court s judgement represents a vindication for the traders who have said for years that they were victims of a series of miscarriages of justice they argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were normal commercial practices in order to appease public anger towards the banks over the financial crisis after a decade long battle to clear their names the supreme court ruled the criminal trials of mr hayes and mr palombo were unfair and overturned their convictions speaking outside court mr hayes said the decision had been a long time coming after his cruel and pernicious sentence he spent five and a half years in jail it destroyed my family i missed most of my son s childhood he said adding that it also led to the end of his marriage for so long i ve been an international fugitive and now i can move on with my life or try to asked if he would seek compensation he told the bbc s world at one that he would seek further legal advice no amount of money gives you back that time and actually no amount of money would make me feel better about that time he said crazy e perience mr palombo said it had been a crazy e perience i don t even know how i feel right now he said it s a mi ture of relief happiness the serious fraud office which brought the original case against the traders said it would not seek a retrial mr hayes and mr palombo were among a group of traders and brokers prosecuted for rigging interest rates in nine criminal trials in london and new york between and mr hayes a former trader at swiss bank ubs was the first banker jailed over the scandal in originally sentenced to years in prison he reduced it to years on appeal and was later released in january mr palombo was sentenced to four years in jail in he was also released in what was libor libor or the london interbank offered rate was a key interest rate used to set borrowing costs for trillions of dollars worth of financial deals it became the focus of allegations of wrongdoing following the financial crisis in dozens of city traders were accused of trying to manipulate what level libor was set at to help the banks they worked for libor was phased out after pa media carlo palombo centre left and tom hayes centre right celebrate after having their convictions overturned the libor scandal came to light in when it was discovered that banks were artificially inflating rates to profit from trading and were also lowering them to mask the troubles they faced following the outbreak of the global financial crisis the financial crisis began in and led to the collapse of us investment bank lehman brothers which sent shockwaves through the global financial system triggering recessions across many countries the bbc uncovered evidence of a much larger state led rigging of interest rates under pressure from central banks and governments across the world during the financial crisis evidence implicating downing street and the bank of england was suppressed throughout the criminal trials in us courts said there was no evidence traders had broken any laws or rules and all the american convictions were quashed leaving the uk the only country in the world where what they were accused of was criminalised in the uk the traders cases had been blocked from reaching the supreme court by the court of appeal five times between and lord leggatt one of five justices reviewing the case said jury direction errors made during the trials of the former bankers made the convictions unsafe and therefore could not stand that misdirection undermined the fairness of the trial he added however the court also said there had been ample evidence for a jury to reasonably conclude hayes had conspired with others to manipulate submissions used to compile the libor rate no winners here conservative mp sir david davis said the judicial system needed a shake up following wednesday s judgement this scapegoating e ercise happened as a result of collusion between the banks and government agencies he said in a statement the serious fraud office sfo acknowledged the judgement and said it had determined it would not be in the public interest for us to seek a retrial mr hayes solicitor karen todner called for a full public inquiry into the convictions and for the justice system to be reformed tom has missed out on formative years with his son time with his family and the loss of his career and his home she said time he will never get back she added there are no winners here now the supreme court has e

faisal islam trump s tough tariff tactics are getting results days ago share save faisal islam economics editor bbc news faisalislam share save getty images japan is a big deal for president donald trump s upheaval of the world s trading system on his own terms it could now be said that his aggressive approach is yielding tangible results right from the off the us side has been talking up the chances of a deal with japan but despite several delegations the deal had been strangely elusive until now in a narrow sense this is a win for the trump approach especially if japan becomes the domino that leads the rest of the world to come into line japan now has the best deal or rather the least worst deal of all the nations with major trade surpluses with the us the general tariff of to be charged on japanese goods being imported to the us is higher than the uk s but the uk has no surplus as i ve reported before the fury of the japanese negotiators during talks was noted among washington dc diplomats accustomed to the nation s e treme politeness trump says us has struck trade deal with japan what the us japan deal means for asia and the world tokyo was playing hardball the japanese finance minister described the nation s trillion holding of us treasury bonds the largest in the world as a card that could be put on the table it was rumours about hedge funds in japan dumping us bonds following trump s liberation day tariffs announcement in april that sparked a wider sell off and bigger questions over the world s biggest economy and safe haven status of the us dollar so the reaching of a deal matters hugely in and of itself and as an e ample to other major economic blocs including the european union eu the deal comes on the day the japanese host eu leaders in tokyo there had been some chatter about japan the eu and canada coordinating their retaliation this stops any such initiative some members of the eu will wonder why a similar deal cannot be struck at the very moment that germany and france up the ante on retaliation perhaps against the us tech giants the world awaits the details here but it is clear that japan has protected its agricultural imports though will import more us rice it is unclear what can change the lack of popularity of large american cars in the country though japanese private companies will be backed to invest half a trillion dollars in the us in some form japan has done this deal when it might have waited out to see how things develop and international markets react when trump s tougher tariffs for a host of countries come into force on august the domestic political weakness of its prime minister may have been a factor though other countries including indonesia and the philippines have also done deals the big picture though is a weary acceptance of the us levying what would have been a year ago unthinkable tariffs on its major allies for fear of something worse in japan s case it was a tariff threatened by trump tariff revenue rising for the us tariffs are now raising significant sums for the us treasury without retaliation against us e porters at over bn so far this year about of us federal revenue is coming from tariffs versus more typically the us treasury secretary scott bessent thinks that the annual tariff take will be bn it is way off the amount raised by income ta es but a notable amount it is being taken without direct retaliation and without right now the market turmoil seen earlier however the story does not end here who is actually paying these tariffs ultimately us consumers will pay a large part in terms of the prices they pay for imported goods in the past bessent and others have suggested that a rising value of the us dollar would help mitigate the cost of imports for consumers the opposite has happened the dollar has slumped in the first half of this year losing of its value against a basket of world currencies this will add to the cost of imports in addition to the tariffs there is a wider canvas here too the governor of the bank of england andrew bailey said this week that the most crowded trade in the market at the moment is short dollar he added that established safe haven patterns in markets especially the us dollar were essentially breaking down there is a reduction of e posure to the dollar as companies and traders now take out trades or hedges designed to ensure they are protected against its decline the governor said as i ve discussed before there is suspicion in the markets that this weaker dollar may actually have been part of the point of these interventions designed to help boost for e ample american rust belt manufacturers regain competitiveness on top of that the us has also helped its great rival china to at least make a case to the rest of the world that it can be a more stable trade partner for this first stage of the great global trade war japan is an important win for the white house which will push

economist for europe at jll a property company said the ecb s decision to hold rates indicates it is keeping its powder dry as the economic situation continues to evolve the bank is already

disruption disrupts supply chains she adds as happened during the coronavirus pandemic d ago cest higher investment in defence and infrastructure should support growth christine lagarde says she

appellant r respondent v palombo appellant uksc uksc pic uk supreme court july the key to the decision to overturn the convictions is that the judge hearing the case erred by telling the jury at the

the quashing of tom hayes and carlo palombo s convictions adds to the woes besetting the serious fraud office says jonathan fisher kc barrister at red lion chambers fisher e plains the supreme court makes clear that the failure in this case stemmed from judicial error specifically the misdirection of the jury by treating as a matter of law something that is actually a matter of fact but this does not e onerate the sfo completely the supreme court criticised the sfo for not making clear the precise nature of its case from the outset this highlights just how challenging it is to prosecute financial market fraud cases in the criminal courts this isn t just an issue in the uk only last week in the united states former hsbc trader mark johnson had his fraud conviction overturned after a nine year struggle so today s ruling is not in isolation it reflects the broader reality that these cases are inherently comple and much careful thought needs to be given before a decision to prosecute is taken the consequences of a failed prosecution can be devastating for the individual involved in this case it is e tremely troubling that both defendants spent time in prison when as the supreme court has now made clear they shouldn t have d ago cest today s supreme court judgment is a personal triumph for tom hayes and for carlo palombo says maia cohen lask partner at law firm corker binning cohen lask e plains both have long contended that they were unfairly scapegoated for behaviour that was not only endemic in the city in the early s but also in government during the banking crisis in the judgment does not go so far as to e onerate them indeed the judgment states that there was ample evidence on which a jury could have convicted however the judgment is a comprehensive vindication of the argument hayes and palombo have been making for many years that if a libor euribor submission was influenced by trading advantage it could still be a genuine and honest answer to the question posed by the definition despite calls for an investigation into the wider aspects of rate manipulation and the role of large banks in the early s and the treasury in it is unlikely that these calls will be heeded by those with the power to act after all libor as a means of setting reference rates has been replaced and reforms to euribor have radically altered its operation so it could be argued that remediation has already occurred in my view the judgment will bring to an end a murky period without further light being cast through the lens of an independent inquiry d ago cest today s press conference heard criticism of the serious fraud office s role in the libor convictions tom hayes s lawyer karen todner has e plained that today s supreme court judgment is critical of the drafting of the indictment by the sfo and their team she added the prosecution of individuals by organisations other than the cps i include in this as well as the sfo the post office and the rspca should be removed the only body who should be bringing criminal prosecutions in the united kingdom are the crown prosecution service the dual role of the sfo as investigator and prosecutor creates a substantial conflict of interest which creates miscarriages of justice d ago cest apple and google face more uk antitrust scrutiny away from the supreme court ruling britain s competition regulator

chrome dominate the mobile browser market on iphones and android devices respectively cma head sarah cardell said in a statement apple and google s mobile platforms are both critical to the uk economy

water inspectorate and the environment agency to reset a sector tarnished by scandals over sewage spills and financial mismanagement after a major review of the sector the environment secretary steve reed said the government will abolish ofwat in the biggest overhaul of water regulation in a generation we will bring water functions from four different regulators into one a single powerful regulator responsible for the entire water sector will stand firmly on the side of customers investors and the environment and prevent the abuses of the past the creation of a new regulator was one of recommendations made by sir jon cunliffe in his review of the england and wales water industry cunliffe warned this sector requires fundamental reform on all sides how we manage the demands on water how the system is regulated how companies are governed and how we manage the critical infrastructure on which we all rely speaking to reporters this morning cunliffe compared the current situation to the great stink of cunliffe also suggested that it could take two years to set up the replacement for ofwat and suggested some civil servants could lose their jobs under the shake up but there was disappointment in some quarters that the independent water commission was not allowed to give full consideration to the hypothetical renationalisation of the sector as unite general secretary sharon graham puts it water workers and the public will just think this report is a bad joke it doesn t even consider returning water to public ownership if the government thinks a new regulator will solve the problems of privatisation they will be badly disappointed the public s bills are due to rise by a third over the next five years we are e periencing hosepipe bans seeing rivers clogged with sewage

steve thomas prospect deputy general secretary said of today s cunliffe review this is an important and timely review following years of underinvestment in the water sector and its regulators it is essential that the specialist workforce of the new single regulator is given the requisite power and investment to do its job effectively whilst ensuring that environmental regulation remains robust and is not diluted recommendations around strengthening the regulator s ability to recruit and retain the right staff through greater pay fle ibility would be a welcome first step in achieving this the government must also ensure that any decisions regarding the abolition and merging of arms length bodies in this space is done through meaningful engagement with trade unions and the specialist

the office for budget responsibility s twice yearly forecasts the ifs rejects the idea the obr should only produce one forecast a year as some commentators have suggested instead it says reeves should implement plans to give herself a margin next spring instead of in as planned it says this is an elegant and sensible solution to the tension between having a single fiscal event but two forecasts each year if at the second forecast the government is slightly on the wrong side of where it wants to be no immediate action is required if it s a long way on the wrong side with a current budget

howls of outrage show a rational debate is unlikely f rance is skint but the french are in denial to judge by the howls of outrage from the left and the hard right of the french political spectrum you would think the prime minister françois bayrou had just taken a javier milei style chainsaw to public services announced doge style mass layoffs or imposed swingeing pay cuts but it was bayrou s suggestion that the french should give up two of their cherished public holidays easter monday and may the anniversary of the end of the second world war in europe and work instead to increase economic output and hence government revenue that provoked the anger jean luc mélenchon the leader of the hard left france unbowed lfi party accused the centrist prime minister of leading a race towards an economic financial and social abyss for the greater suffering of all the socialist party leader olivier faure described the proposals as a demolition plan for our french model and jordan bardella president of the hard right national rally rn said the the proposal to cancel the two holidays was a direct attack on our history the hard left and the populist right threatened to bring down the government with no confidence motions in the autumn when the budget will be put to a hung parliament as they did with bayrou s short lived predecessor michel barnier last year as is so often the case the sound and fury in the echo chamber of french political rhetoric is out of all proportion to reality bayrou proposes a standstill in public sector pay pensions welfare benefits and ta thresholds in which with inflation forecast to increase slightly to about next year means a modest erosion of living standards for most people and a slightly increased ta take better off pensioners will pay more ta poorer ones will pay less the measures are supposed to reduce the deficit by bn to of economic output next year only defence spending will be increased in line with france s commitment to nato given europe s deteriorating security situation this is hardly a draconian austerity purge for a country that had a deficit of of gdp last year the highest in the euro area and which by most rational measurements is living beyond its means national debt has risen to of gdp higher than any eu country e cept greece and italy but while their debt piles are falling france s

more state e penditure in france s ta to gdp ratio was significantly higher than the average of in advanced economies the country has too many layers of public administration which together employ million people of the total workforce bayrou proposed that one in three retiring civil servants should not be replaced drawing immediate protests from trade unions representing teachers health workers

holidays would go some way towards narrowing the gap between the number of hours worked per inhabitant in france compared with competitors such as germany italy spain and the uk not to mention the united states or south korea but the french are militantly resistant to any attempt to remove acquired social rights regardless of the economic situation changing demography or dire public finances as they showed with sustained social unrest over macron s raising of the retirement age to it s not that french workers actually work much less than their european counterparts but france has less of its

approaching a tipping point as demanding and difficult as it may be getting our public finances under control from is imperative for debt sustainability he added france has long enjoyed the indulgence of bond market vigilantes because of its ability to raise revenue and a presumption that its debt was implicitly backed by germany since a french financial crisis would trigger severe turbulence in the eurozone but several credit ratings agencies have recently lowered france s sovereign rating because of a concern that the government will be unable to enact serious deficit cutting measures without a parliamentary majority french people need to get real about their fiscal predicament before it descends into an acute crisis so far there is little sign of that reality dawning on either the political class or the population the left just keeps repeating that the government should soak the rich and reimpose a wealth ta even though that would make little more than a symbolic dent in the deficit the populist right argues that the state could save all the money it needs if only it stopped paying benefits to immigrants those numbers don t add up either with so many politicians encouraging voters to go on believing that public money grows on trees or can be borrowed in unlimited amounts mélenchon has argued in the past that france should default on its debt it is hard to have a rational debate on the budget the stage is set for another battle of wills in parliament and probably in the street if the uneasy grouping of centrist and conservative parties supporting bayrou

fullscreen top of the tree when it comes to female economists is chancellor rachel reeves pictured here at the annual mansion house dinner in london britain photograph isabel infantes reuters the quiet matter of fact takeover of women holding senior economist roles heather stewart from rachel reeves to the mpc and thinktanks to unions and lobby groups many of the authoritative voices we hear discussing economics are female rachel reeves is rightly proud of being the first female chancellor of the e chequer but she is far from alone the commanding heights of economic policymaking in the uk are becoming much less male at a westminster thinktank event last week about whether labour is still a mission led government one of the most striking things was not the panel s answer which you can probably guess but the fact that it was made up of three women and one token man the institute for government s director hannah white was joined by its chief economist gemma tetlow and the no nonsense new director of the institute for fiscal studies helen miller as well as stephen bush of the financial times elsewhere the resolution foundation is now run by ruth curtice a former treasury economist rain newton smith another economist has the task of repairing the cbi s scandal rocked reputation as its director general two of the four deputy governors of the bank of england are women too as are the leaders of a string of powerful trades unions this female takeover has been a quiet and matter of fact one but it marks a significant change very noticeable upon returning to covering the field after a few years away it has not yet been reflected in the gender balance of students picking economics at gcse a level or as a degree unfortunately research commissioned by the bank of england showed this year that economics classes at all levels remain about male but if anything that makes it all the more striking that many of the most authoritative voices we will hear in the run up to reeves s autumn budget will be female aside from straightforward fairness there are at least three potential benefits of this feminisation of the economic debate the first which reeves herself has talked about directly is the simple power of e ample giving girls and young women the perception they could do jobs such as these and while it must have been shattering shedding a few tears at the dispatch bo was a powerful part of that many women of every age will have identified with her women just do cry more than men a yougov poll in found that of women had cried at least once a month in the past year for men it was this has zero bearing on their ability to do their job and if anything may point to sincerity rather than insouciance whatever you think of their policies theresa may s tears as she resigned surely reflected better on her character than david cameron s jaunty little hum a second potential benefit of having women at the top of economic policymaking should be better decision making jill rutter a former treasury official and now senior research fellow at thinktank uk in a changing europe recalls that back in the s there were virtually no women around the table making ta policy decisions and it was very interesting because almost all the senior people there had non working wives she recalls being stared at if as the junior official present she piped up to ask how a particular policy might go down with women four decades later boris johnson s bloke heavy government was apparently capable of similar myopia when senior cabinet office official helen macnamara testified at the covid inquiry she argued that senior women s voices were all but absent from decision making in the pandemic decisions were being taken where the impact on women was either lost or ignored she said in her written evidence skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion macnamara pointed to a lack of consideration about the demands that school closures would place on families the potential impact of lockdown on domestic violence victims and the rules around pregnancy and birth by contrast she said time was found to discuss the implications for hunting shooting and fishing across today s economic landscape there are plenty of pressing issues women may feel particularly moved to pursue not least the gender pay gap which reeves has pledged to narrow and its less noticed sister the gender pensions gap standing at a shocking for private pension savings which the work and pensions secretary liz kendall is e pected to highlight in a speech on monday the third and more speculative potential upside of having more female economic policymakers is a shift in the tone of debate not all women are moderate or reasonable or ground their arguments in the everyday liz truss is certainly a countere ample but i would gently suggest that on average they tend to be a bit less prone to bluster bravado and what the kids call main character syndrome that was why it was depressing on tuesday to see reeves at the mansion house describing regulation as the boot on the neck of british enterprise in danger of choking off innovation no doubt the violent language was aimed at grabbing headlines which it did and communicating a clear message to her city audience but it was jarring to read such a brute phrase in a public speech by the uk s most powerful woman there is no shortage of tedious macho language around keir starmer with anonymous briefers proudly telling columnists the prime minister s politics are hard labour and accusing mps of knobheadery perhaps as her crunch autumn budget approaches reeves can help the government to find a different more relatable vocabulary judging by the comments of that mainly female panel at the institute for government debate on labour s first year in power last week the debate in the coming months will be every bit as robust as ever but it will be fascinating to see if it can be conducted in a different calmer way and perhaps more closely anchored to what macnamara argued was missing from that shameful johnson period people and families and how people actually live their lives e plore

trump visits the federal reserve tussles with jerome powell president trump visited the federal reserve to inspect an ongoing renovation and disagreed with the fed chair about the project s final cost in an e traordinary moment business trump visits federal reserve and tussles with jerome powell in e traordinary moment updated july pm et originally published july pm et by rafael nam president trump sparred with fed chair jerome powell over the final cost of the federal reserve s renovations during an unusual visit to the central bank chip somodevilla getty images hide caption toggle caption chip somodevilla getty images president trump visited the federal reserve on thursday to inspect an ongoing renovation of the central bank s washington d c buildings and in an unusual moment then disagreed with fed chair jerome powell about the final cost of the project economy why the federal reserve s building renovations are attracting the white house s ire the fed s e pensive renovation project has become a point of contention as the president seeks to pressure the central bank to lower interest rates more quickly the renovation s cost has soared from billion to billion in recent years during the visit trump and powell accompanied by sen tim scott the south carolina republican chairman of the senate banking committee stopped to address news cameras trump waving a document claimed the costs had now reached billion as powell visibly shook his head in disagreement so we re taking a look and it looks like it s about billion dollars trump said went up a little bit or a lot i haven t heard that from anybody at the fed powell responded the fed chair then took the document looked at it and said the additional costs the president was citing had been for a separate building whose construction was completed five years ago trump then appeared more conciliatory as reporters shouted questions i don t want to be personal i just would like to see it get finished trump said referring to the renovations and in many ways it s too bad it started but it did start and and it s been under construction for a long time trump also appeared to avoid delving into his recent criticisms of powell well i d love him to lower interest rates but other than that what can i tell you trump said as powell chuckled powell appears before the senate banking committee on june as part of his semiannual testimony before congress kent nishimura getty images hide caption toggle caption kent nishimura getty images trump later seeks to ease tensions later trump again addressed reporters this time without powell and sought to ease tensions from his earlier appearance i thought we had a good meeting trump told reporters no there was no tension there was no tension interview highlights a well run economy needs an independent federal reserve says former reserve bank head in the run up to thursday s visit to the fed trump had been relentlessly attacking powell describing the fed chair as a numbskull and as too late to cut interest rates in his second appearance before the press on thursday trump again called for lower borrowing costs although he said he felt good about his relationship with powell i believe that the chairman is going to do the right thing maybe a little too late as the e pression goes but i believe he s going to do the right thing trump said an unusual visit in more ways than one trump s visit marks the first time a president has visited the federal reserve since when president george w bush attended the swearing in of ben bernanke a previous chair of the central bank that s because the fed has long protected its independence in setting interest rates which is critical in retaining the confidence of global investors presidents in modern times have mostly respected the fed s independence and sought to avoid being seen as interfering with its decisions the fed has held interest rates steady this year in large part over concerns that the president s tariffs could spark an increase in inflation the latest data showed consumer prices rising from a year ago at a faster clip than the previous month that uptick makes it unlikely the fed will cut rates at its next policy meeting later this month despite trump s pressure trump has threatened to fire powell trump s frustrations boiled over last week when he threatened to fire powell later he backed down without fully ruling it out the fed has not responded to trump s criticism but powell has previously made clear he intends to serve out his term as fed chair which e pires next may last year when asked whether he would resign if trump requested it powell responded with an emphatic no politics trump floats firing the federal reserve chair as white house criticism boils economy fed holds interest rates steady signals rate cuts of later this year an attempt to fire powell would likely roil financial markets and lead to a huge legal fight legal scholars believe a fed chair can be fired only for cause such as for breaking the law the trump administration s attacks against the fed renovation project are seen as another way to ramp up pressure on powell and as potentially a reason to fire him though legal scholars have said such an e cuse is unlikely to pass legal muster the fed chair has previously pushed back attributing the cost overruns to mitigations for lead and asbestos as well as to inflation which has raised the cost of building projects nationwide jerome powell federal reserve donald trump flipboard,NPR-Economy,Economic

juillet la loi duplomb du nom du sénateur lr portant le te te était destinée à lever les contraintes à l e ercice du métier d agriculteur mais elle déclenche ces derniers jours des débats enflammés sur le site de l assemblée nationale une pétition critiquant son impact sur l environnement et la santé approchait les millions de signataires vendredi juillet d un côté ses défenseurs saluent l adoption de la loi la fnsea premier syndicat agricole et ses alliés des jeunes agriculteurs évoquent un premier pas pour relancer notre appareil français de production agricole de l autre de nombreuses voi déplorent un moyen de favoriser un modèle agro industriel qui ne répond en rien au attentes du monde paysan selon les mots de la confédération paysanne troisième syndicat agricole du pays en somme l illustration d un clivage entre deu visions opposées de l agriculture une loi qui permet de réduire notre dépendance selon ses défenseurs la réalité de ce que demande l écologie c est la fin de l agriculture française assénait dimanche sur franceinfo laurent duplomb moins nous produirons en france plus nous serons soumis à acheter des produits qui viennent d ailleurs et qui ne correspondent pas du tout à nos normes le sénateur ancien président de la chambre d agriculture de la haute loire se fait ainsi le porte voi de la fnsea le te te reprenant plusieurs revendications anciennes du syndicat majoritaire agricole historiquement opposé à la réduction de l utilisation de pesticides analyse sur le site the conversation le chercheur ale is aulagnier sans ce te te de loi moins de production plus de dépendance une perte de compétitivité face à des agricultures moins disantes résume le patron de la fnsea arnaud rousseau sur pour le syndicat cette loi dénonce une vision restrictive de l écologie sacrifiant les agriculteurs sur l autel de l idéologie que répond on en face les opposants à la loi y voient la vision datée d un modèle agricole productiviste qui sacrifie la durabilité à la performance immédiate et sans avenir selon les mots du réseau des centres d initiatives pour valoriser l agriculture et le milieu rural civam ou encore un modèle agricole destructeur de l environnement et dangereu pour la santé selon le mouvement terre de liens notre association demande au président de la république de ne pas promulguer la loi duplomb qui va à l encontre des principes de précaution et de promotion d un modèle agricole durable embraye l association générations futures oui il est possible de réduire le caractère intensif a ce modèle qu ils pointent unanimement du doigt ils opposent les nombreuses pratiques agroécologiques agriculture biologique agroforesterie diversification des cultures pâturage dans les vergers biocontrôle qui permet de réguler les maladies et ravageurs en utilisant leurs prédateurs naturels implantation de haies paillage association de cultures pastoralisme rotation annuelle des cultures selon une liste non e haustive de l institut national de recherche pour l agriculture l alimentation et l environnement inrae ces types d agricultures ont un point commun réduire les conséquences indésirables et travailler avec la nature plutôt que contre elle définit vincent bretagnolle chercheur cnrs au centre d études biologiques de chizé ces systèmes réduisent aussi la consommation d énergie d eau d engrais de produits phytopharmaceutiques et de médicaments vétérinaires selon les termes définis par la loi du octobre de quoi améliorer la qualité des sols et de l eau et capturer du carbone tout en accroissant la productivité dépeint le rapport de l ipbes le groupe de scientifiques spécialistes de la biodiversité sous l égide de l onu des pratiques déjà e périmentées en france au er juillet e ploitations agricoles étaient certifiées haute valeur environnementale selon le ministère et plus de e ploitations étaient engagées dans une démarche de production biologique d après l agence bio oui il est possible de réduire le caractère intensif et de faire sans glyphosate et sans néonicotinoïdes on l e périmente et ça ne nuit pas au rendements ou de manière marginale assure vincent bretagnolle qui anime depuis trente deu ans une zone d e périmentation de nouvelles pratiques agroécologiques dans le centre ouest quand on réduit l usage de l agrochimie ça réduit les charges des agriculteurs ces alternatives ont émergé dès les années retrace l inrae mais elles ne représentent aujourd hui que environ des agriculteurs selon vincent bretagnolle la loi duplomb favorise plutôt une minorité d agriculteurs en face on retrouve donc le modèle plus intensif aussi appelé productiviste soit une agriculture qui cherche un rendement élevé avec notamment un recours important au intrants chimiques la filière alimentaire doit poursuivre une double ambition celle de continuer à répondre au besoins alimentaires des français et de contribuer à nourrir le monde définit aussi la fnsea dans son pacte productif pour c est le modèle dominant soit environ des agriculteurs en système de grande culture constate vincent bretagnolle et la tendance va dans le sens de l agrandissement des e ploitations en la surface d une e ploitation en france est de hectares en moyenne contre en note l insee qui précise qu un quart des e ploitations les plus grandes condensent de la surface agricole française cette vision de l agriculture entraîne avec elle de nombreuses pollutions de l eau et des sols ainsi que des dégradations de l environnement les activités agricoles sont aussi l une des premières causes de l effondrement de la biodiversité au niveau mondial la mécanisation a supprimé du linéaire des haies bocagères depuis ce qui porte préjudice à la biodiversité depuis la surface des prairies a diminué de et depuis de la population d oiseau des milieu agricoles a disparu illustre l insee mais pour les chercheurs les débats actuels concentrés sur ces deu visions sont réducteurs la loi duplomb favorise plutôt une minorité au sein de ces analyse vincent bretagnolle ceu qui sont dans des modèles très productivistes tournés à presque vers l e portation dont le modèle économique repose sur de très grandes superficies une très grande mécanisation et beaucoup d intrants une lecture que partage ale is aulagnier sur the conversation la loi duplomb était censée être une réponse législative au malaises agricoles elle comprend en réalité des mesures techniques qui ne concernent qu un nombre réduit d e ploitants en particulier ceu qui possèdent les e ploitations à l orientation la plus intensive une indispensable adaptation face au réchauffement climatique face à ce débat une réalité s impose pourtant dans un conte te de réchauffement climatique et d effondrement de la biodiversité l agriculture est forcée de s adapter et de se transformer premières victimes les agriculteurs ont en effet vu leurs rendements diminuer leurs vendanges avancer leurs terres s assécher et de nouvelles maladies fragiliser leurs élevages pour vincent bretagnolle le modèle productiviste n est pas viable sur le long terme puisqu il n y a pas de production sans écosystèmes et biodiversité selon les chercheurs la transition est donc la seule solution l adaptation au changement climatique et la restauration des services écosystémiques sont indispensables pour assurer la performance productive et économique le déploiement de l agroécologie est considéré comme la voie la plus pertinente en europe pour y parvenir juge en effet christian huyghe directeur scientifique agriculture à l inrae quand le giec prévient dans son dernier rapport que certaines zones actuellement consacrées à l agriculture et à l élevage deviendront climatiquement inadaptées jusqu à à l échelle mondiale d ici à et plus

avancer sur ce conflit hier lors d un comité interministériel présidé par françois bayrou mesures ont été présentées pour booster le secteur du tourisme avec un objectif de milliards d euros de recettes d ici à nous sommes aujourd hui à milliards comment peut on y arriver alors que par e emple cet été certains restaurateurs et responsables d hébergement tirent la sonnette d alarme quand on regarde les chiffres au global nous avons des effets météorologiques qui impactent bien évidemment le début de cette saison la canicule et ensuite on l a vu tout à l heure sur la météo des endroits plus ou moins pluvieu quand on regarde les chiffres entre janvier et avril que nous avons déjà consolidés nous avons plus d arrivées notamment internationales sur le territoire et nous avons déjà battu un record sur la rentrée de nos recettes internationales donc le comité interministériel du tourisme a réaffirmé notre volonté de continuer à être la première destination mondiale mais à travers un tourisme durable innovant inclusif et puis effectivement cette ambition d avoir milliards de recettes internationales en amenant beaucoup plus de touristes étrangers et en leur permettant de rester plus longtemps c est à dire en améliorant notre offre touristique et en montant en gamme cette offre touristique qu est ce qui pêche dans la stratégie française parce qu à la fois vous dites que nous sommes encore peut être plus longtemps mais encore première destination en nombre de touristes mais en même temps les touristes dépensent peu en france en fait c est la dépense moyenne c est à dire qu il nous faut en france arriver à proposer des produits qui permettent au touristes de se poser dans une région dans une destination aujourd hui nous avons plutôt des touristes de passage et c est vrai qu on arrive à avoir des formules de trois jours à paris trois jours à bordeau trois jours dans d autres destinations alors que nous souhaitons renforcer notre offre touristique il faut que nous arrivions à rénover notre hôtellerie particulièrement dans le moyen et haut de gamme les et étoiles qui nous manquent aujourd hui dans cette offre touristique mais nous avons d autres atouts les campings nous sommes le pays le plus équipé en plein air et cela plaît puisque notamment dans la ruralité nous avons une augmentation des touristes qui cherchent des activités de plein air mais aussi des visites patrimoniales de la gastronomie et de l notourisme nous avons des marges de progression sur l ensemble de l notourisme et ces marges de progression cela veut dire des recettes et cela veut dire aussi contribuer à l amélioration de la situation de l économie française cliquez sur la vidéo pour regarder l entretien en intégralité les mots clés associés à cet article monde palestine bruno

homme était employé depuis ans à la papeterie qui compte à ce jour salariés et avait été nommé contremaître en dans le rapport l e pert du cabinet technologia relève que le salarié e primait régulièrement des difficultés liées à sa charge de travail notamment en raison du cumul des dimensions techniques et administratives de son poste la direction en avait été informée selon le rapport qui indique que dès soit un an après sa promotion comme contremaître des tensions sont relevées dans les évaluations internes une situation pointée ensuite dans tous les bilans annuels tout comme une mauvaise ambiance et une surcharge de travail des signau d alerte remontés en l e pert observe un manque de soutien de la hiérarchie du contremaître et assure que la situation professionnelle difficile rencontrée par le salarié était connue de la direction et s inscrivait dans la durée plusieurs signau d alerte ont été formellement remontés au cours de l année par divers canau témoignant d un mal être persistant poursuit le rapport les réponses organisationnelles apportées apparaissent dans l analyse de l e pert tardives ou insuffisamment calibrées au regard de la gravité de la

entretien plus de décès que de naissances c est un phénomène qu on observe partout en europe la france était une e ception pour la première fois depuis ans la france a enregistré décès pour naissances en un an le démographe didier breton revient pour franceinfo sur les conséquences de cette inversion lire plus tard pour sauvegarder cet article connectez vous ou créez un compte franceinfo sans

télévisions publié le temps de lecture min entre le er juin et le mai décès ont été recencés en france pour naissances sylvie cambon ma ppp le réarmement démographique voulu par emmanuel macron n y a rien fait du moins il attendra pour la première fois depuis la seconde guerre mondiale l insee a enregistré plus de décès que de naissances en france sur une période de douze mois consécutifs souligne l économiste françois geerolf sur entre le er juin et le mai on décompte ainsi décès et naissances le solde naturel c est à dire la différence entre le nombre de naissances et celui des décès est donc de le résultat d une tendance à l uvre depuis plusieurs années avec une baisse constante de la natalité mais dont l inversion était anticipée par l insee en fermetures d écoles concurrence des générations pénuries de main d uvre pour comprendre les enjeu à moyen et long terme de ce changement démographique franceinfo a interrogé didier breton chercheur associé à l institut national d études démographiques ined franceinfo comment e pliquer que le solde naturel soit devenu négatif en france didier breton d abord il y a une tendance à la baisse du solde naturel en france depuis alors que le nombre de naissances diminue d années en année face à ce constat il n y a pas eu le rebond de natalité attendu la période ne semble pas favorable à un projet de parentalité ou d agrandissement de la famille pour des raisons économiques ou des incertitudes sur le futur le nombre d enfants moyen par femme décroît alors que les couples vont décider de faire des enfants plus tard que dans les générations précédentes en vingt ans la part des adultes ne souhaitant pas avoir d enfants a aussi augmenté une étude de milan bouchet valat et laurent toulemon parue en juillet pdf indique que des ans hésitent à devenir parents le modèle familial avec plusieurs enfants est de plus en érosion de l autre côté on observe une augmentation du nombre de décès chaque année c est que la population en âge de mourir au dessus de ans est de plus en plus nombreuse de à il y a eu énormément de naissances durant le baby boom d après guerre l hiver dernier par e emple la france a connu une vague de mortalité en raison d un épisode violent d épidémie de grippe c est un phénomène qu on observe partout en europe et qui est amené à se poursuivre dans les années à venir la france et son solde naturel positif étaient jusqu alors une e ception dans le continent didier breton démographe à l ined à franceinfo si cet indicateur est traditionnellement calculé entre chaque année civile les si premiers mois de ne donnent pas l impression que la tendance va s inverser cette année quand cette baisse de la natalité aura t elle le plus d effets pour notre société la baisse de naissances qu on observe depuis n aura ses premiers effets qu en ou lorsque ces enfants nés atteindront l âge adulte et le solde négatif qu on observe aujourd hui et qui va continuer à baisser n aura ses premiers effets importants que dans ans c est un effet domino ce que l on appelle l inertie démographique une population qui n est pas encore née aujourd hui va affecter les sociétés et l économie durant les ou ans qui suivent a quelles conséquences concrètes peut on s attendre il y aura d abord des conséquences économiques si nous n avons pas recours à l immigration la population va diminuer en même temps que la taille du marché français et le nombre de consommateurs disponibles le premier secteur touché à court terme sera celui de la petite enfance les assistantes maternelles les entreprises vendant des produits pour bébé et des couches autre conséquence il va y avoir moins d enfants dans les écoles et maternelles dans les milieu rurau cela peut se traduire par la fermeture de classes d écoles réduisant les places disponibles en termes d attractivité c est une catastrophe pour un maire de petite commune qui souhaite garder la population et les parents sur son territoire cette baisse ne va en effet pas affecter les territoires de la même manière dans les grandes villes enfants en moins auront moins d impact que enfants en moins dans une terre rurale certains territoires connaissent déjà des difficultés didier breton démographe à l ined à franceinfo enfin à plus long terme moins d enfants c est moins de personnes sur le marché de l emploi dans ans c est moins de cotisants pour des retraites des pénuries de main d uvre s il y a plus d anciens que de jeunes comment va t on pouvoir prendre en charge les plus âgés il y a donc une vague en cours de baby boomers qui arrivent à l âge de la dépendance a partir de il y aura de moins en moins de gens formés au métiers du soin et puis les futurs jeunes feront ils le choi de devenir médecins si on ne fait rien il y aura là de vraies conséquences qui auront des coûts économiques importants avec cette dépendance on va aussi par e emple observer une concurrence entre générations que ce soit pour les places à l hôpital ou pour les rendez vous chez les médecins ou pour les grandes élections où va se décider l avenir du pays par le haut ou pas le bas de la pyramide des âges didier breton démographe à l ined à franceinfo ce problème peut emporter tout notre modèle de cohésion sociale c est à dire le climat qui e iste entre différentes catégories de population en particulier entre les âges emmanuel macron a évoqué un réarmement démographique est ce une façon de s adapter à cette bascule on peut et on doit s adapter les politiques vont en avoir l obligation dans les années à venir et ne pourront pas faire comme si cela n e istait pas tout est une question du modèle de société que l on souhaite mettre en place ce qui est sûr c est que malgré les politiques natalistes on ne peut pas forcer les gens qui n ont pas envie d être parents sachant qu avoir un enfant coûte du temps et de l argent et que l on sait que la part des gens qui vont choisir de ne pas en avoir va augmenter didier breton démographe à l ined à franceinfo il y a deu grands modèles de réponse choisis par les pays dans lesquels le solde naturel est négatif depuis plusieurs années le premier est celui de l allemagne et de l espagne les deu pays ont fait appel à l immigration pour préserver leur économie et subvenir au besoins des métiers en tension mais pour cela il faut être attractif ce sera un enjeu dans le futur les pays d afrique et d asie connaîtront eu aussi une baisse de natalité dans les années à venir ce qui va faire aussi baisser l offre migratoire dans un conte te de pénurie ce sont les migrants qui auront le choi du pays un autre modèle a été choisi par le japon où la natalité diminue depuis ans plutôt que de recourir à l immigration la nation a décidé d augmenter la productivité par l automatisation des tâches et la
